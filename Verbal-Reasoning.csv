In the 1960s, the U.S. started vaccinating kids for measles. As expected, children stopped getting measles. But something else happened. Childhood deaths from all infectious diseases plummeted. Scientists saw the same phenomenon when the vac- cine was introduced elsewhere around the world. Now there's an obvious answer to the mystery: children who get the measles vaccine are probably more likely to get better healthcare in general. But Michael Mina and his colleagues have found there's more going on than that simple answer. “We found measles predisposes children to all other infectious diseases for up to a few years,” Mina says. Like many viruses, measles is known to suppress the immune system for a few weeks after an infection. But previous studies in monkeys have sug- gested that measles takes this suppression to a whole new level: it erases immune pro- tection to other diseases. (National Public Radio).;Children who catch measles will also catch other diseases. ;Children who received the measles vaccine receive better healthcare overall.;Scientists have found evidence that measles may reduce immunity to other diseases. ;While studies have found what measles did to monkeys, the same cannot be said for humans. ;C
How can cheese be aged so long, but when it's in the refrigerator for longer than a few weeks it goes mouldy? Aged cheese wheels have something called a “rind.” Rinds are most obvious on a cheese like brie. Some cheeses are also waxed on the outside (think gouda.) It's basically an outer dehydrated shell that is maintained by the cheesemak- ers, and either one certain type of edible mould is allowed to flourish on it (like brie,) or it is wiped with saline regularly to keep mould from growing on it (cheddar). Once you penetrate the rind (slice the cheese into blocks) and stop maintenance, the “inner” non-dehydrated cheese is sus- ceptible to mould it picks up from the envi- ronment. (Reddit) ;Once untreated cheese is exposed to the envi- ronment it will eventually go bad. ;It makes no difference to how long a cheese lasts if the outer layer of mould on cheese is edible or not. ;The mouldy rind found on cheddar is the most effective for preserving its cheese. ;Cheese only expires in a refrigerator once its rind has been breached. ;A
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is where your kidneys suddenly stop working properly. It can range from minor loss of kidney func- tion to complete kidney failure. AKI nor- mally happens as a complication of another serious illness. It's not the result of a physi- cal blow to the kidneys, as the name might suggest. This type of kidney damage is usu- ally seen in older people who are unwell with other conditions and the kidneys are also affected. It's essential that AKI is detected early and treated promptly. Without quick treatment, abnormal levels of salts and chemicals can build up in the body, which affects the ability of other organs to work properly. If the kidneys shut down completely, this may require tempo- rary support from a dialysis machine, or lead to death. (National Health Service) ;Acute kidney injury is widely believed to be the result of a physical blow to the kidneys. ;Acute kidney injury is limited to older people who have other health conditions. ;Without dialysis, acute kidney injury may lead to death. ;It cannot be said that acute kidney injury means that your kidneys stop working. ;D
Individuals with high levels of psychopa- thy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism — known as the “dark triad” of personality traits — do not appear to have an impaired ability to empathize, according to new research. But these individuals are not inclined to use this ability. “Sometimes psy- chopaths (people with dark traits) are understood as callous persons, not being able to empathize with others, while at other times they are understood as fully functional in that regard, but just don’t care,” said Petri Kajonius. “We wanted to find out what the data in a HR-community sample, purposed to be in tune with person- nel, would say?” The study of 278 partici- pants found that dark personality traits were negatively related to the disposition to empathize, but had no relationship with the ability to empathize. “The results show that overwhelmingly, HR-people with dark traits, are not lacking the ability to empathize, but score low in their disposi- tions to do so,” Kajonius told PsyPost. (psy- post.org) ;The study used HR people because of the higher rates of the dark triad found among them. ;Human resources professionals who can empathise can be psychopaths. ;People who do not care for others’ feelings are for the most part those who are unable to empathise. ;Researchers discovered that many people with the dark triad behaved in an empathetic way. ;B
The Assyrian empire was built during a time of heavy precipitation and successful harvests. But now we can tell, from climate records, that the civilization experienced a series of megadroughts that likely triggered the collapse of the empire—weakening agri- culture and amplifying conflict. The impact of drought in this region was dependent on where the Assyrians were located in north- ern Iraq. The Tigris River is so deeply cut into the surrounding soil that you can’t do large scale-irrigation there. That’s why rain- fall was so crucial to their lives. The Assyrians were much more vulnerable to the impacts of prolonged and severe drought than people downriver. (colorado.edu).;The Assyrians by the Tigris lacked the irriga- tion skills of the Egyptians by the Nile. ;Geological features cannot be said to exacer- bate or diminish the impact of climatic changes.;It is possible that the Assyrian Empire rose during a climatological anomaly. ;Had the Assyrians built their empire further downriver it would not have fallen when it did.;C
Patricia Goodhines and colleagues at Syracuse University examined how 83 uni- versity students’ sleep was affected on days when they did and didn’t take marijuana over a two-week period. Each day, the stu- dents filled in questionnaires asking how often they had used marijuana or alcohol the previous day, and their reasons for taking the drug. Participants also rated the quality and duration of their sleep that night, and how fatigued they felt during the day. The team found that 29 of the students used cannabis specifically as a sleep aid on at least one night of the 14-day study period. Using the drug was related to longer dura- tion of sleep and less time spent awake during the night, suggesting that there are some elements of sleep that cannabis may improve. But importantly, the drug didn’t help participants get to sleep any faster or improve their perceived quality of sleep – and worse, it actually increased their levels of fatigue the following day. (British Psychological Society);The study found marijuana to be an effective aid for falling asleep. ;Marijuana was found to be an effective aid for keeping a person asleep. ;Only a minority of participants felt more fatigued the day after smoking marijuana. ;Marijuana was found to be a more effective sleeping aid than alcohol. ;B
Drinking red wine may be better for your microbiome than drinking other types of alcohol, according to a study of 3,000 people. Caroline Le Roy and colleagues at King’s College London found that red wine drinkers had a greater diversity of bacteria living in their guts, compared to people who drank beer, cider, white wine or spirits. The team found that this held true even when the age, wealth, diet and socioeco- nomic status of the participants were taken into account. The team think red wine drinkers may have more of a mix of microbes than other drinkers because of polyphenols, defence chemicals in red wine that act as antioxidants. The findings may partly explain why red wine is linked to heart health, says Le Roy. Drinking red wine rarely, such as once every two weeks, seemed to be enough to observe an effect on gut microbiota, she says. (New Scientist);Drinking alcohol will make a positive impact on a person’s gut bacteria. ;Drinking wine more frequently than once every two weeks will enhance its effects.;Drinking wine in and of itself was not found to be beneficial for gut bacteria. ;Drinking red wine will improve your health. ;C
Little is known about the difficulties experi- enced by those with high intelligence. Specifically, those with a high intellectual capacity (hyper brain) possess overex- citabilities in various domains that may pre- dispose them to certain psychological disorders as well as physiological condi- tions involving elevated sensory, and altered immune and inflammatory responses (hyper body). A study surveyed members of American Mensa in order to explore psychoneuroimmunological (PNI) processes among those at or above the 98th percentile of intelligence. Participants were asked to self-report prevalence of both diag- nosed and/or suspected mood and anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disor- der (ASD), and physiological diseases that include environmental and food allergies, asthma, and autoimmune disease. High sta- tistical significance and a remarkably high relative risk ratio of diagnoses for all exam- ined conditions were confirmed among the Mensa group when compared to the national average. (Science Direct) ;The Mensa study found that people with above average intelligence have more psy- chological disorders. ;eing highly intelligent appears to make people inclined to have certain mental health issues.;Highly intelligent people appear to have higher rates of nut allergies. ;People who had average intelligence were found to have below average rates of these conditions. ;B
Patients were 390 percent more likely to say their pain was well-controlled when the person taking their blood was courteous, according to a new study. “It's not surpris- ing that a courteous healthcare provider can improve the patient experience, but we were shocked at just how powerful that factor was,” said lead author Mario Moric. “We thought the more needle sticks, the higher the pain perception, but we found that effect was small. It turns out the experi- ence of pain is much more significantly affected by the attitude of the people treat- ing you,” Moric said. Patients were asked about the pain they experienced while having blood taken and about the courtesy of the people who took the blood samples. The results showed that pain was signifi- cantly lower when the healthcare worker taking blood was courteous − for example, asking about patients' previous experiences with needles and taking their preferences into account. (UPI) ;Sometimes drawing blood is painless.;Being pricked with a needle twice can be less painful than being pricked once.;Courteous people drawing blood reduced the amount of pain by 390 percent. ;Asking about previous experiences with nee- dles is the best way to reduce pain levels. ;B
Previous research has found that people born in January were 13 percent more likely to develop schizophrenia and at 17 percent greater risk of bipolar affective disorder. Scientists have been puzzled about the finding, with some suggestions that a lack of Vitamin D from sunlight could be driv- ing the higher incidence. But now researchers at the University of Cardiff have discovered that mothers who gave birth in autumn or winter had 20 percent more corti- sol − the stress hormone − in their saliva than those who gave birth in the spring or summer. Professor Ros John said: “As higher levels of cortisol in pregnant women have previously been associated with a higher risk of children developing mental health disorders, the new findings could explain why these disorders are more common in people born during the winter months. (The Telegraph);The lack of Vitamin D from sunlight has been shown not to cause depression in winter babies. ;Women have higher stress levels in winter due to a lower level of sunlight at that time. ;A woman’s stress levels during late preg- nancy may influence psychological risks in her children. ;Children born in January are the most likely to develop mental health disorders. ;C
A study by Cancer Research UK reveals that while the number of people smoking has fallen by 15 percent since 2011, the total number of cigarettes smoked has dropped by 24 percent. Around 14.7 percent of UK adults smoke, down from 20.2 percent in 2011, official figures show. And the new research shows that the average smoker now has 10.6 cigarettes a day − down from 12.4 a day in 2011. It comes in the wake of the ban in smoking indoors in 2007, and the ban on billboards and print adverts four years earlier. Meanwhile, the number of adults vaping has risen by 70 percent in just two years, with one in four children trying e-cigarettes. Public Health England say vaping is now the most popular and effec- tive way for smokers to quit. (The Telegraph);Vaping is the main reason for the fall in the number of smokers. ;There is reason to believe that the indoor smoking ban had a knock-on effect. ;It cannot be said that today’s smokers are lighter smokers than those of yesterday. ;Soon more adults will be vaping than smok- ing cigarettes. ;B
A study of 352 Olympic and professional ath- letes found high rates of dental problems, even though they brushed their teeth on aver- age twice a day. Researchers believe the relentless intake of sports drinks, energy gels and bars are to blame, due to their high sugar content. Intensive exercise may also prompt changes in saliva and the immune system that further exacerbates the damage. Published in the British Dental Journal, the study found that 49.1 per cent had untreated tooth decay, with a large majority showing early signs of gum inflammation. Dr Julie Gallagher said: “We found that a majority of athletes in our survey already have good oral health related habits in as much as they brush their teeth twice a day, visit the dentist regu- larly, don’t smoke and have a healthy general diet. However, they use sports drinks, energy gels and bars frequently during training and competition.” (The Telegraph);Brushing your teeth on average twice a day can be insufficient to prevent tooth decay. ;The changes to saliva prompted by intensive exercise is what primarily causes tooth decay. ;Non-British athletes were not found to have as high rates of dental problems. ;Sports drinks and energy gels and bars were found to produce bad oral health in athletes. ;A
Fasting every other day could be the secret to losing weight while staying healthy because it mimics humans’ caveman diet, a new study suggests. A trial showed that people who ate no food at all for 36 hours then anything they felt like for 12 hours lost more than three kilograms within a month. Crucially, their immune systems remained stable, even after six months, in contrast to many diets which aim to restrict calorie intake consistently each day. Scientists at the University of Graz in Austria believe the strength of alternate-day fasting (ADF) may lie in its adherence to hunter-gatherers’ patterns of eating thousands of years ago, when food was not available every day. However, they warn that it may not be suit- able for everyone and that further studies need to prove its safety over the long-term. (The Telegraph) ;Alternate day fasting is effective for weight loss because it is the same as the caveman diet. ;Participants on the alternate-day fasting diet lost more than three kilograms without exer- cise.;Scientists at the University of Graz have pio- neered a diet called alternate-day fasting. ;Because it mimics earlier human eating patterns, alternate-day fasting may be a healthy option.;D
Ethan Bernstein and Stephen Turban, two Harvard Business School academics, set out to test the impact of open plan offices. At the first company, the authors found that face-to-face interactions were more than three times higher in the old, cubicle-based office than in an open-plan space where employees have clear lines of sight to each other. In contrast, the number of e-mails people sent to each other increased by 56% when they switched to open-plan. In the second company, face-to-face interactions decreased by two-thirds after the switch to open-plan, whereas e-mail traffic increased by between 22% and 50%. Why did this shift occur? The authors suggest that employees value their privacy and find new ways to preserve it in an open-plan office. They shut themselves off by wearing large headphones to keep out the distractions caused by nearby colleagues. Indeed, those who champion open-plan offices seem to have forgotten the importance of being able to concentrate on your work. (The Economist) ;The ability to quickly speak to each other in open plan offices resulted in a drop in emails.;Workers in offices with cubicles are more productive than those in open-plan offices. ;Open plan offices encourage employees to find new ways to be left alone. ;The cost savings of an open plan layout were cancelled out by the adverse effect on com- munication. ;C
In a new study published in American Sociological Review, Asst. Prof. Mathijs de Vaan and Prof. Toby Stuart show that the likelihood of someone using opioids increases significantly once a family member living in the same household has a prescription. They also find that the chances of a relative obtaining a prescription for opioids within a year after a relative they live with gets one rises by 19 percent to over 100 percent, depending on family circum- stances. Individuals from low-income households, for example, are the most likely to secure their own prescription after a family member does. De Vaan and Stuart suggest two reasons for this contagion: when a family member takes painkillers, other relatives in the home observe first- hand its effects. Patients also typically receive more pills than they need, which means relatives may be tempted to experi- ment with leftovers sitting in the medicine cabinet. (University of California, Berkeley);The majority of people getting new prescrip- tions for opioids are from households where opioids are already used by other family members. ;It cannot be said that the wealthier have easier access to obtaining opioids. ;It would be wrong to say that if doctors were to prescribe fewer pills, then other family members would be less likely to try them. ;It would be wrong to say that the impact of family circumstances on prescribing of opi- oids cannot really be measured. ;D
Boosting a single molecule in the brain can change “dispositional anxiety,” the ten- dency to perceive many situations as threat- ening, in nonhuman primates, researchers from the University of California, Davis, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison have found. The molecule neurotrophin-3 stimulates neurons to grow and make new connections. The finding provides hope for new strategies focused on intervening early in life to treat people at risk for anxiety dis- orders, depression and related substance abuse. Current treatments work for only a subset of people and often only partially relieve symptoms. “There are millions of people worldwide who suffer from debili- tating anxiety and depressive disorders,” said Andrew Fox. “These disorders are also some of the leading causes of disability and days lost to disability.” Anxiety disorders often emerge around adolescence and can continue to affect people for most of their lives. (University of California, Davis) ;Scientists have discovered a way to relieve dispositional anxiety in humans. ;Once anxiety emerges at adolescence, it will continue to affect people all their lives. ;The study may indicate a new avenue for treating anxiety in humans. ;Currently available treatments for anxiety are largely ineffective. ;C
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are a rela- tively new form of nicotine delivery device and the prevalence of their use is rapidly growing in many countries. E-cigarettes have been put forth as a way to reduce nico- tine dependence and have been reported to be less addictive than traditional cigarettes. However, there have been numerous reports of people who become addicted to e- cigarettes and report typical symptoms of nicotine addiction, including with a dose- response effect. E-cigarette use has even been suggested to lead to an increased risk of addiction, especially among young people, with higher exposure to doses of nicotine compared to people who smoke traditional cigarettes, as e-cigarettes are used in times and places where smoking is prohibited. While some suggest e-cigarettes will help to quit smoking or reduce this addiction, others have reported that using e- cigarettes has a negative impact on success- fully quitting. Using e-cigarettes may have little effect on reducing the frequency of nicotine use. (MDPI) ;There is reason to believe that e-cigarettes may be achieving the opposite of their stated intent. ;The prevalence of e-cigarette use is rapidly growing all around the world. ;E-cigarettes help people give up traditional cigarettes because they are a socially accept- able alternative. ;E-cigarettes actually contain more nicotine than traditional cigarettes. ;A
The bystander effect occurs when the pres- ence of others discourages an individual from intervening in an emergency situation. The greater the number of bystanders, the less likely it is for any one of them to pro- vide help to a person in distress. People are more likely to take action in a crisis when there are few or no other witnesses present. Social psychologists Bibb Latané and John Darley popularized the concept of the bystander effect following the infamous 1964 Kitty Genovese murder in New York City. As 28-year-old Genovese was stabbed to death outside her apartment, neighbours failed to step in to assist or call the police. Latané and Darley attributed the bystander effect to the perceived diffusion of respon- sibility (onlookers are less likely to inter- vene if there are other witnesses who seem likely to do so) and social influence (indi- viduals monitor the behaviour of those around them to determine how to act). (Psychology Today);Having no witnesses to a person’s actions increases their likelihood of acting. ;The bystander effect only presents itself in modern disconnected societies. ;A person’s likelihood of intervening is directly proportional to the number of others present. ;People are more likely to remain bystanders if they are worried about being affected themselves. ;A
In many cases, having high standards can drive success, but for some people, dili- gence and motivation can shift into perfec- tionism, a sorely misunderstood personality trait that can have dangerous consequences. Perfectionism has increased significantly over the past three decades, a recent analy- sis shows. Young people in particular place higher demands on themselves and on others. Our dog-eat-dog world, full of impeccable images of what our bodies, careers and aspirations should look like, is creating a rising tide of millennials who may be putting themselves at risk of mental and physical illness in their search for the perfect life. An epidemic of perfectionism poses a serious, even deadly problem, according to those researching the trend. (New Scientist) ;Older people are largely unaffected by the increase in perfectionism seen over the past three decades. ;Perfectionism is driving millennials to behave in rash and unpredictable ways. ;The increase in perfectionism over the past 30 years can be mainly blamed on the media. ;Unrealistic expectations are considered to be an essential reason why perfectionism has increased. ;D
Looking at data from two large annual sur- veys of college undergraduates covering the years 2007-2018, researchers found a broad worsening of mental health indicators, par- ticularly in the second half of the study period. “It suggests that something is seri- ously wrong in the lives of young people and that whatever went wrong seemed to happen around 2012, or 2013,” said study co- author Jean Twenge. She noted that this was around the time smartphones became common and social media moved from being optional to mandatory among young- sters. “It’s difficult to think of any other event that began around that time, and then got stronger on until 2018,” Twenge said. The rate of moderate to severe depression rose from 23.2% in 2007 to 41.1% in 2018, while rates of moderate to severe anxiety rose from 17.9% in 2013 to 34.4% in 2018. (Reuters);The study found that depression and anxiety rates increased at a steady rate between 2007 and 2018. ;Smartphones and social media are the rea- sons why mental health worsened after 2012- 2013. ;It cannot be said for certain that social media and smartphones increased mental health issues.;The increase in anxiety among college under- graduates was greater than among others of the same age. ;C
Researchers randomly selected a group of 1,769 residents of Brno, in the Czech Republic. None had a history of cardiovas- cular illness, and 42 percent owned pets. They then scored them on the American Heart Association’s seven measures of heart health and compared scores of the 24 per- cent of the people who owned dogs and the 18 percent who owned other pets with those of the rest who owned none. Owners of any pet scored higher than those who didn’t own a pet, but dog owners scored higher than both. The authors do not conclude that owning a dog by itself assures protection against cardiovascular disease. Instead, the physical activity that dog ownership requires may be the key. Other factors may play a role as well. “Owning a dog increases the sense of well-being in general, decreases loneliness and decreases rates of depression,” said Dr. Francisco Lopez- Jimenez. (New York Times) ;Dogs are the best animal for improving car- diovascular health in humans. ;Pets other than dogs were not found to increase the sense of well-being. ;Owning a physically demanding pet has pos- itive benefits for your health. ;Owning a dog is probably enough by itself to protect against cardiovascular disease.;C
"The human desire for companionship may feel boundless, but research suggests that our social capital is finite—we can handle only so many relationships at one time. Social scientists have used a number of ingenious approaches to gauge the size of people’s social networks; these have returned estimates ranging from about 250 to about 5,500 people. Looking more specif- ically at friendship, a study using the exchange of Christmas cards as a proxy for closeness put the average person’s friend group at about 121 people. However vast our networks may be, our inner circle tends to be much smaller. The average American trusts only 10 to 20 people. Moreover, that number may be shrinking: From 1985 to 2004, the average number of confidants that people reported having decreased from three to two. This is both sad and conse- quential, because people who have strong social relationships tend to live longer than those who don’t. (The Atlantic) ";There is reason to believe that Americans are becoming less-trusting people. ;The average person has between 250 and 5,500 friends in their social networks.;Christmas cards are an excellent way to determine the number of friends a person has. ;As the average number of confidants that people have has decreased, so have life spans. ;A
A study found that a given person, in 2006, eating the same amount of calories, taking in the same quantities of macronutrients like protein and fat, and exercising the same amount as a person of the same age did in 1988 would have a BMI that was about 2.3 points higher. “Our study results suggest that if you are 25, you’d have to eat even less and exercise more than those older, to pre- vent gaining weight,” Jennifer Kuk said. “However, it also indicates there may be other specific changes contributing to the rise in obesity beyond just diet and exer- cise.” Just what those other changes might be are still a matter of hypothesis. First, people are exposed to more chemicals that might be weight-gain inducing. Second, the use of prescription drugs has risen dramati- cally since the ‘70s and ‘80s. Finally, Kuk and the other study authors think that the microbiomes of people might have some- how changed between the 1980s and now. (The Atlantic) ;Gaining weight involves factors that may well be outside the average person’s immedi- ate control. ;Losing weight was much easier 20-30 years ago than it is today. ;Average BMI was 2.3 points higher in 2006 than in 1988 among people of the same age. ;Chemicals and prescription drugs are to blame for today’s slower metabolisms. ;A
Today’s children spend more time gazing at screens than ever, with smartphones and tablets competing with the television for their attention. But while some argue that technology can support child development, industry experts suggest that too much screen time could in fact result in a loss of imagination. According to a poll by daynurseries.co.uk, almost two-thirds of childcare professionals believe that screens are making children less creative. The survey found that fewer than half (48 per- cent) of nursery workers said there are chil- dren at their nursery with imaginary friends. Furthermore, a total of 72 percent agreed that far fewer children have imagi- nary friends now than five years ago, while 63 percent of those questioned said they think screens are to blame for this decline of inventiveness. David Wright agreed with the findings, explaining that there is a “gen- eral issue with children’s creativity and development of imagination”. (The Independent) ;A consensus has been reached on how tech- nology harms child development. ;Screen time appears to negatively impact on children’s imaginations. ;Over two-thirds of childcare professionals think screens make kids less creative. ;Fewer than half of children today were reported to have an imaginary friend. ;B
It wasn’t just the coastline and the ocean surface that was drenched in oil after the Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010. Craig McClain and his colleagues used remotely operated underwater vehicles to survey the Gulf of Mexico around the site of the disas- ter. They did the survey in June 2017 and compared their findings with surveys done in the two months directly after the oil spill. While the number of animals increased in that time, the diversity was lower. There has also been a change in which animals inhabit the area. The communities seen in 2010 and 2017 were less than 20 percent similar in composition. Surprisingly, they found an abundance of arthropods, including red shrimp, a white caridean shrimp, and the Atlantic deep-sea red crab. McClain says they may be attracted to the site because the hydrocarbons that break down in the wake of an oil spill can mimic the chemicals in sex hormones that they use to find mates. (The Independent) ;A survey of the Gulf of Mexico seven years after an oil spill found that some crabs were plentiful. ;Animal diversity is lower and overall num- bers have not yet recovered to pre-spill levels. ;The lower diversity in animals is due to how the oil irreversibly changed the area. ;The types of animals that inhabit the area have been permanently changed. ;A
As devastating as forest fires are in the rain- forest, the destructive power of fire is neces- sary for the preservation of other ecosystems, where parts of the natural fauna and flora develop only thanks to the fires. Animals and plants often have a natu- ral capacity for resistance in such fire- dependent ecosystems. The nature of the fires varies, however. In grasslands, savan- nahs, some forests and wetlands, only a moderately intense ground fire sweeps through, ensuring that the open landscape structure is maintained. Rare but very intense fires are characteristic of bush land- scapes or forests. They consume old and diseased trees, create new habitats and ensure an ecological rejuvenation of the tree population. Intervening in these ecosys- tems, for instance by preventing small fires in order to protect the population, can have fatal consequences. Over time, more and more combustible material accumulates. Even harmless fires can quickly turn into highly destructive walls of flames. (Deutsche Welle);Fires are a natural part of the life cycles of all forests around the world. ;Human attempts to control fires have actu- ally made some worse when they occur. ;Mild fires can be beneficial but intense fires are always damaging. ;The reason some trees are resistant to fires is because of their thick barks. ;B
In a new set of studies, researchers found that people showed greater goal commit- ment and performance when they told their goal to someone they believed had higher status than themselves. It didn’t help people at all to tell their goals to someone they thought had lower status, or to keep their objectives to themselves. “Contrary to what you may have heard, in most cases you get more benefit from sharing your goal than if you don’t – as long as you share it with someone whose opinion you value,” Howard Klein said. Results showed that people were motivated by sharing a goal with someone they thought had higher status because they cared about how that higher-status person would evaluate them. “You don’t want them to think less of you because you didn’t attain your goal,” Klein said. In these studies, higher-status people were those who the participants thought had more prestige and respect than they did. (Ohio State University) ;People got the best advice on achieving their goals from those of higher status than them- selves. ;People who do not share their goals with others do not achieve them. ;The fear of being looked down upon was found to be an excellent motivator. ;The study found the opinions of those with lower status do not matter. ;C
A panic attack is when your body experi- ences a rush of intense mental and physical symptoms. It can come on very quickly and for no apparent reason. A panic attack can be very frightening and distressing. Most panic attacks last for between 5 and 20 min-utes. Some panic attacks have been reported to last up to an hour. The number of attacks you have will depend on how severe your condition is. Some people have attacks once or twice a month, while others have them several times a week. Although panic attacks are frightening, they're not danger- ous. An attack won't cause you any physical harm, and it's unlikely that you'll be admit- ted to hospital if you have one. Be aware that most of these symptoms can also be symptoms of other conditions or problems, so you may not always be experiencing a panic attack. (National Health Service);The triggers for panic attacks are well under- stood. ;In bad cases people can experience several panic attacks per day. ;While most panic attacks are brief, some can last over an hour in duration. ;A person may think they are having a panic attack when something else is wrong. ;D
It's not uncommon to accidentally ingest expired medication, but not to fear: In gen- eral, most of them are not toxic when expired, but they can lose their effectiveness over time. When a drug is made, the time it takes to break down (known as its shelf life) is determined. Drug makers guarantee that if their product is used within the shelf life, it will work to its maximum potency and safety. This being said, even when medica- tion passes its shelf life, it remains partially effective – but quantifying when and how fast the potency decreases is difficult. A study done by the U.S. military measured how ineffective medications actually become after their expiry date and found that of over 100 drugs tested, over 90 percent were sufficiently effective several years after their expiry date. The bottom line: Expiry dates are a conservative measure to make sure you're using medication of the highest potency possible. (The Globe and Mail) ;Although gradually losing effectiveness, most expired medications are still good enough. ;The main risk from taking medication beyond its shelf life is that it might not work, not that it might do you harm. ;Studies have found that all medications are still safe to take even after they have expired. ;Ninety percent of medications are still suffi- ciently effective years after they expire. ;A
Scientists combined data from two large, long-term studies: one including 69,744 women and another of 1,429 men, all of whom completed questionnaires that assessed their feelings about the future. After controlling for health conditions, behaviours like diet and exercise, and other demographic information, the scientists were able to show that the most optimistic women (top 25%) lived an average of 14.9% longer than their more pessimistic peers. For the men the results were a bit less dra- matic: The most optimistic of the bunch lived 10.9% longer than their peers, on aver- age, the team reported. The most optimistic women were also 1.5 times more likely to reach 85 years old than the least optimistic women, whereas the most optimistic men were 1.7 times more likely to make it to that age. (Science Magazine) ;Optimistic men were more likely to reach 85 years old than optimistic women. ;The study on women is more accurate due to its larger sample size. ;Optimists had higher life expectancy because they also lead healthier lives. ;Optimism had a greater impact on life expectancy in women than in men. ;D
Impostor syndrome is a psychological pat- tern in which an individual doubts their accomplishments and has a persistent inter- nalized fear of being exposed as a “fraud”. Despite external evidence of their compe- tence, those experiencing this phenomenon remain convinced that they are frauds, and do not deserve all they have achieved. Individuals with impostorism incorrectly attribute their success to luck, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent than they perceive them- selves to be. While early research focused on the prevalence among high-achieving women, impostor syndrome has been recog- nized to affect both men and women equally. (Wikipedia) ;An essential part of impostor syndrome is dismissing your own achievements. ;At one time impostor syndrome was believed to only affect women and not men. ;Impostor syndrome is a mental illness in which people do not recognise their achieve- ments. ;People who have achieved their success through luck will not feel like impostors. ;A
Psychosis, which is not a disease but a symptom of a brain illness, usually begins in late adolescence and young adulthood. The causes are not known. The disorder, which is genetically complex, tends to run in families — more than 100 genes have been linked to schizophrenia, for example. Its onset is often precipitated by episodes of intense stress or severe chronic stress. There are many possible signs that someone is at risk of developing a psychotic break, but too often they are often dismissed as symp- toms of typical adolescent behaviour, experts say. Psychosis rarely comes on sud- denly. Rather, the person gradually experi- ences changes in thoughts and perception, making it difficult for the person to recog- nize what is real and what is not, the National Alliance on Mental Illness points out. (New York Times) ;Psychosis has been found to be exclusively passed on through families. ;Intense or severe chronic stress will precede a psychotic break. ;Signs of impending psychosis are frequently dismissed as normal behaviour. ;A psychotic break can be averted if the signs are recognised in time. ;C
Teenagers are twice as likely to be hyperac- tive if their mothers were anxious during pregnancy and their early years, a new study has shown. While around five percent of youngsters usually experience some symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) by the age of 16, the number jumped to 11 percent of those whose mothers suffered anxiety. Although some anxiety is natural during pregnancy and the early years of mother- hood, the researchers measured extreme symptoms such as trembling, insomnia, dizziness and sweating. In the study around one quarter of the women tested showed medium to high anxiety. Researchers say they cannot be sure of a causal link, but have speculated that high levels of stress hormones may have an impact on brain development. (The Telegraph);The majority of youngsters with ADHD symptoms have mothers who were anxious in pregnancy or early childhood. ;High levels of stress hormones in the mother affects the way a child’s brain develops. ;Having an anxious mother roughly doubles the chances of a child having ADHD. ;Anxious mothers had higher rates of children with Attention Deficit Disorder. ;C
he IWSR, in conjunction with BDS Analytics, says a growing number of con- sumers are showing a preference to con- sume both booze and marijuana. “Our research shows that up to 40% of adults 21 and over consume cannabis in states where it’s legal,” said Jessica Lukas. “Cannabis presents substantial opportunities across consumer industries, including new occa- sions in which alcohol cannot and will not play. Consumers will continue to look to cannabis products over alcohol for occa- sions when they are feeling creative, need to get motivated, or seeking health, medical or wellness benefits.” The IWSR is warning that makers of adult beverages need to begin anticipating consumers’ shifting demands now if they want to avoid trouble down the road. Last year, Americans drank 3.345 billion cases of alcohol, a 0.8% decline from 2017. That worked out to about 7.9 bil- lion gallons of booze, roughly 160 million bathtubs full. (Fortune) ;Drinking has declined since 2017 due to people smoking more legal marijuana. ;Alcohol companies have so far proved reluc- tant to diversify to cannabis products. ;Consumers prefer cannabis to alcohol in cer- tain situations although they increasingly consume both. ;More adults consume alcohol than cannabis even in states where cannabis is legal. ;C
South Korean imports of beer from Japan plunged 97% in August from a year earlier amid a popular backlash against Japanese products that has spread as relations between the two countries sour. South Korea imported just $223,000 worth of Japanese beer in the month, down from $7.57 million a year earlier, the Maeil Business Newspaper said, citing prelimi- nary data from Korea Customs Service. Japan has held the largest share of South Korean beer imports every year since 2010, with sales surging more than sixfold by 2018 to $78.3 million. The boycott of Japanese goods has spread since Tokyo first imposed export restrictions on key chip materials in July. The trade dispute may not be without its winners, however − shares in South Korean brewer Hite Jinro Co. have risen to the highest level in more than a year amid swift sales of its new beer. (Bloomberg);South Korea is no longer the biggest importer of Japanese beer. ;Changes in tariffs on Japanese beer have seen imports to South Korea drop. ;The boycott of Japanese beers is meant to increase consumption of South Korean beer. ;It is not unreasonable to believe that Japanese beers may no longer lead South Korean beer imports. ;D
Most earthquakes occur along faults, or deep cracks in the crust, where blocks of Earth slide against each other and create friction. This process builds stress and strain in the crust until the tension releases suddenly as seismic energy, producing an earthquake. Geologist Wendy Bohon com- pares an earthquake to breaking a pencil: You can see the pencil bend a little bit as you apply more pressure, but at some point, enough tension builds up so that the pencil snaps. Almost 75 percent of earthquakes occur along tectonic plate boundaries, which cover thousands of miles of Earth’s surface. We know earthquakes are con- stantly rattling our planet, so much so that geologists can confidently say that there is a 100-percent chance that an earthquake will strike somewhere in the world each day. In Southern California alone, the data show that an earthquake occurs almost every three minutes, on average. (National Geographic) ;A majority of earthquakes occur along spe- cific parts of the Earth’s surface. ;Earthquakes can occur anywhere. ;In some places, such as South Carolina, earth- quakes occur on a very regular basis. ;There is a 100% chance of an earthquake occurring somewhere along the tectonic plates each day.;A
One of the hottest times in Earth’s history came 56 million years ago, during the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, or PETM. The crux of the issue is the fact that Earth’s orbit actually looks like a very slightly squashed circle, or ellipse. Astronomers call this eccentricity, and it varies predictably over time, becoming more or less squashed in a regular cycle. But the degree of eccentricity has noticeable, if subtle, effects on the climate, says Richard Zeebe the co-author of a study on the topic: “If we look at the past 100 million years, we see distinct relationships between changes in eccentricity and climate”. Scientists were able to pinpoint the sudden temperature spike of the PETM at 56 million years ago, right when Earth’s orbit was at its most eccentric, or elliptical. A more eccentric orbit would mean that more solar radiation is hitting Earth, so it makes sense that it would cause warming. (astronomy.com) ;The study suggests that the Earth’s elliptical orbit is a factor in current global warming. ;A spike in the Earth’s temperature 56 million years ago was not caused by greenhouse gases. ;The Earth’s orbit around the sun is becoming increasingly elliptical over time. ;Scientists found that the hottest the Earth has ever been was 56 million years ago.;B
Samsung’s smartphone shipments in Central and Eastern Europe during Q2 2019 grew a significant 21% year-on-year (YoY), and 8% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), solidify- ing the OEM’s lead in the market, according to the latest research from Counterpoint’s Market Monitor service. The growth in Samsung’s shipments came even as the overall smartphone market in CEE remained flat. Samsung benefitted from the drop in Huawei’s volumes after the US trade ban. Excellent traction for its refreshed A-series also helped the com- pany’s performance in the region. Samsung ended the quarter with a 40% market share, twice that of its nearest competitor, Huawei. Commenting on Samsung’s performance, Peter Richardson said, “Samsung has been the main beneficiary of the drop in Huawei (and Honor) volumes, as it could offer a comparable range of smartphones and fill the portfolio gaps with its recent launches under the A-series. The refreshed A-series was the star performer for Samsung.” (coun- terpointresearch.com);Samsung doubled the size of its market share in Central and Eastern Europe. ;Samsung’s smartphones are comparable to Huawei’s but cost a little more to buy. ;Samsung is the market leader in a part of the world where smartphone sales have not been increasing. ;Without the refreshment of its A-series, Samsung would not have seen the growth that it did. ;C
Smell happens when the receptors in your nose pick up aromatic molecules in the air. These molecules ooze out of objects and living organisms in the environment around you. You smell more aromatic molecules during the summer because hot, muggy air holds more of the molecules and enables them to move through the atmo- sphere more quickly. The opposite happens when it's cooler and drier in the fall: air molecules contract together and leave less space for odour molecules to move through. “In summer, we have just more of a mixture of scent and sort of a wide blend of scent ... we smell a lot more of everything around us,” said Rachel Herz, a neuroscientist. “When it gets cooler and drier, specific scents tend to stand out more — we're able to kind of pull out the scent of leaves, the scent of bark, the scent of grass in more dis- tinct ways.” (CBC) ;It is more difficult to smell specific scents in the summer since we are bombarded by smells. ;Scents are easier to pick out in the autumn because they are stronger in that season. ;When the air is hotter scents can move through the atmosphere more quickly. ;Humidity levels are more important than temperature for transmitting scents. ;A
The spotlight effect is a cognitive bias that causes people to overestimate the degree to which they are observed and noticed by others, as well as the degree to which others care about the things that they notice about them. The spotlight effect is something that we all experience frequently in our every- day life. We experience the spotlight effect because when we think about how other people see us, we suffer from an egocentric bias, which is the tendency to anchor other people’s viewpoints to our own. Essentially, since we are so used to seeing things from our own perspective, we struggle to accu- rately judge what other people’s perspec- tives are like. Since we are so focused on our own appearance and actions, it’s difficult for us to remember that other people are not as focused on what we look like or on what we do, since they are already preoccupied with their own lives for the most part. (effec- tiviology.com) ;People who keep to themselves will experi- ence the spotlight effect more than others. ;Our tendency not to consider others’ perspec- tives is the root cause of the spotlight effect. ;It is mainly people who are self-obsessed that experience the spotlight effect. ;We experience the spotlight effect because we cannot consider other perspectives. ;B
Many planets across the universe probably end up falling into their stars, either because they stray too close, or because the stars expand as they age. We have seen some evidence of this, like clouds of leftover debris and stars full of elements they could- n’t maintain on their own. Alexander Stephan and his colleagues calculated how planets could affect the stars that eat them. They found that a planet falling into a star can make the star brighten for anything from centuries to millennia. And that the star can spin faster as the planet deposits its energy. “The interactions between the planet and star may not be able to kill the star as such, but they can certainly mess it up,” Stephan says. Often, when a star eats a planet, the star can start to spin so quickly that it begins to rip apart, throwing its outer layers off into space. (New Scientist);Planets close to a star will be swallowed when the star expands as it ages. ;By providing it with more energy, a planet can make a star grow larger. ;When a star eats a planet, it will cause it to spin so quickly that it rips apart.;A star’s swallowing of a planet may in fact be a self-destructive act. ;D
The so-called “casual dining crunch” has led to customers turning their backs on chains such as Byron, Strada, Gourmet Burger Kitchen and Jamie Oliver’s restau- rant empire. The number of restaurants falling into insolvency in the year to the end of June 2019 increased by 25% to 1,412 com- pared to 2018, according to research by the accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young. It is the highest number of insolvencies since at least 2014 and is said to reflect tightened consumer spending on the back of concerns about Brexit and rising costs because of the collapse in the value of the pound. UHY Hacker Young said the rapid growth of the casual-dining sector since the 2008 financial crisis had resulted in an oversaturated mid- market, which is still going through a dra- matic shakeout. The research found that hundreds of small independent restaurants had collapsed as well as big chains, such as those owned by the celebrity chef Oliver. (The Guardian);The casual dining crunch saw customers turn away from chains to independent restau- rants. ;Over-expansion in the mid-market sphere is a reason why such restaurants are closing. ;The fall in the value of the pound caused by concerns about Brexit tightened consumer spending. ;Small independent restaurants saw more clo- sures than chain restaurants. ;B
Europe will likely be a large growth market for air conditioners despite the outsized costs of retrofitting older buildings with new cooling systems, said Nicholas Heymann. Currently, only about 20% of European households have air condition- ing, compared with 87% percent of U.S. households and 90% in Japan, due in part to greater emphasis on less energy-intensive forms of cooling in Europe. The number of European households that buy and install a new air conditioning system will increase by an average of 4.3% a year through 2040 as more people move to cities, according to a study published in Environmental Science & Policy. Overall, global air conditioner sales will increase by 700 million units by 2030 and 1.6 billion by 2050, driven mostly by sales in developing countries such as India, according to estimates from the U.S. Department of Energy. (Reuters);Europeans use air conditioning less than Americans since they are more environmen- tally conscious. ;Japan has the highest rate of households with air-conditioning in the world. ;Most European households do not have air conditioning but the biggest increase in sales will be elsewhere. ;Increasing temperatures are why Europeans will buy more air conditioning systems. ;C
The euro area annual inflation rate was 1.0% in August 2019, stable compared to July. A year earlier, the rate was 2.1%. European Union annual inflation was 1.4% in August 2019, stable compared to July. A year earlier, the rate was 2.2%. The lowest annual rates were registered in Portugal (- 0.1%), Greece (0.1%) and Spain (0.4%). The highest annual rates were recorded in Romania (4.1%), Hungary (3.2%), the Netherlands and Latvia (both 3.1%). Compared with July, annual inflation fell in nine Member States, remained stable in six and rose in twelve. In August, the highest contribution to the annual euro area infla- tion rate came from services (+0.60 percent- age points, pp), followed by food, alcohol & tobacco (+0.40 pp), non-energy industrial goods (+0.08 pp) and energy (-0.06 pp). (Eurostat) ;Inflation rates fell throughout the European Union. ;In August 2019 services made a higher contri- bution to the annual EU inflation rate than did non-energy industrial goods. ;Although inflation was the general trend, deflation was also observed. ;Inflation within the Eurozone was over one percent in August 2019. ;C
In July 2019 compared with June 2019, sea- sonally adjusted production in the construction sector decreased by 0.7% in the euro area (EA19) and by 0.1% in the EU28, accord- ing to first estimates from Eurostat, the sta- tistical office of the European Union.

Both NASA and the European Space Agency are reporting that a newly discov- ered comet zooming toward the sun is likely from another star. Astronomers said that it’s traveling at 150,000 kph, so fast it likely originated outside our solar system. It’s 420 million kilometres from the sun and getting closer. Scientists predict the comet will hurtle past the sun in December and keep going until it’s back in interstellar space. Its nucleus is estimated between 2 kilometres and 16 kilometres across. With another comet from outside our solar system so soon, these interstellar passers-by could be more common than thought. Marco Micheli of ESA said “We need to wait a few days to really pin down its origin with observations that will either prove the current thesis that it is interstellar, or perhaps drastically change our understanding.” (AP News) ;The speed of the comet is what proves that it originated from outside our solar system. ;Comets originating from outside our solar system are more common than we thought. ;The comet’s speed is why astronomers believe the comet is an interstellar object. ;Comets from our own solar system only travel at slower speeds. ;C
In optics, an aperture is a hole or an opening through which light travels. The aperture size of a photographic lens can be adjusted to control the amount of light reaching the film or image sensor. In combination with variation of shutter speed, the aperture size will regulate the film's or image sensor's degree of exposure to light. Typically, a fast shutter will require a larger aperture to ensure sufficient light exposure, and a slow shutter will require a smaller aperture to avoid excessive exposure. Reducing the aperture size increases the depth of field, which describes the extent to which subject matter lying closer than or farther from the actual plane of focus appears to be in focus. In general, the smaller the aperture (the larger the f-number), the greater the dis- tance from the plane of focus the subject matter may be while still appearing in focus. (Wikipedia) ;Aperture size is what determines the amount of light that reaches film or an image sensor. ;F numbers on a lens are directly proportional to the size of the aperture. ;A fast shutter speed with a small aperture will produce a worse image than a slow shut- ter speed with a large aperture. ;Aperture is what determines how much of an image is in focus. ;D
As the world warms, ocean temperatures will also increase—a process which, scien- tists predict, will lead to an increase in the intensity of hurricanes. The warmer the temperature of the sea surface that a hurri- cane is moving over, the stronger the storm will become, because heat energy in the water acts almost like a fuel. Furthermore, global sea level rises—which are being driven by climate change—could mean that coastal storms become more destructive, due to the increased risks of storm surges. This will only be exacerbated by the fact that climate change is expected to lead to a rise in hurricane rainfall. While hurricanes are expected to become more intense in future, scientists are still not sure whether climate change will lead to an increase or decrease in their frequency. (Newsweek) ;It cannot be said for certain that hurricane intensity will increase as the world warms. ;Climate change will lead to an increase in the number of hurricanes. ;Hurricanes are now producing more rainfall than they did in the past. ;Scientists believe the rise in global sea levels will probably lead to more intense hurri- canes. ;A
ISO is a camera setting that will brighten or darken a photo. As you increase your ISO number, your photos will grow progres- sively brighter. For that reason, ISO can help you capture images in darker environ- ments, or be more flexible about your aper- ture and shutter speed settings. However, raising your ISO has consequences. A photo taken at too high of an ISO will show a lot of grain, also known as noise, and might not be usable. So, brightening a photo via ISO is always a trade-off. You should only raise your ISO when you are unable to brighten the photo via shutter speed or aperture instead (for example, if using a longer shut- ter speed would cause your subject to be blurry). Although ISO initially defined only film sensitivity, it was later adopted by digital camera manufacturers with the pur- pose of maintaining similar brightness levels as film. (photographylife.com) ;ISO is the setting that determines how bright or dark a photograph will be. ;Photographs taken at high ISO levels will be too grainy to be usable. ;It cannot be said that ISO solely determines a camera sensor’s sensitivity to light. ;In addition to light sensitivity, ISO can also determine the quality of an image. ;D
Capsaicin is an active component of chili peppers, which are plants belonging to the genus Capsicum. It is an irritant for mam- mals, including humans, and produces a sensation of burning in any tissue with which it comes into contact. The seeds of Capsicum plants are dispersed predomi- nantly by birds: in birds, the TRPV1 chan- nel does not respond to capsaicin or related chemicals (avian vs. mammalian TRPV1 show functional diversity and selective sen- sitivity). This is advantageous to the plant, as chili pepper seeds consumed by birds pass through the digestive tract and can ger- minate later, whereas mammals have molar teeth which destroy such seeds and prevent them from germinating. Thus, natural selec- tion may have led to increasing capsaicin production because it makes the plant less likely to be eaten by animals that do not help it disperse. (Wikipedia);Capsicum plant seeds are only dispersed by birds, which is why they need to be spicy. ;A bird’s inability to chew Capsicum seeds is why it is better suited to dispersing them. ;The increase of capsaicin in peppers was the result of evolution. ;Capsaicin only provides a burning sensation to animals that do not help it disperse. ;B
Occupational asthma is asthma that's caused by breathing in chemical fumes, gases, dust or other substances on the job. Occupational asthma can result from expo- sure to a substance you're sensitive to — causing an allergic or immunological response — or to an irritating toxic sub- stance. Like other types of asthma, occupa- tional asthma can cause chest tightness, wheezing and shortness of breath. People with allergies or with a family history of allergies are more likely to develop occupa- tional asthma. Avoidance of occupational triggers is an important part of manage- ment. Otherwise, treatment for occupa- tional asthma is similar to treatment for other types of asthma and generally includes taking medications to reduce symptoms. If you already have asthma, sometimes treatment can help it from becoming worse in the workplace. If it's not correctly diagnosed and you are not pro- tected or able to avoid exposure, occupa- tional asthma can cause permanent lung damage, disability or death. (mayoclinic.org) ;Occupational asthma is a leading cause of workplace-derived illness. ;People do not have to be sensitive to particu- lar substances to develop occupational asthma. ;People with a genetic predisposition to asthma are the ones who also have the work- place type. ;Occupational asthma is limited to people who work under certain conditions. ;B
A boycott of The Sun in Liverpool led to people in Merseyside having more positive attitudes towards the European Union, a study has claimed. The report on tabloid media influence over attitudes towards the EU claims the boycott cut Euroscepticism in the county by more than ten percent. It also noted a “substitution effect of Sun reader- ship to pro-EU papers”, particularly rival tabloid the Daily Mirror. The Sun has faced a boycott in Merseyside ever since its cover- age of the 1989 Hillsborough Disaster, which saw it wrongly claim fans of Liverpool FC had behaved despicably during the crush that claimed 96 lives. The report, authored by Florian Foos and Daniel Bischof, says the long-standing Sun boycott lowered Euroscepticism among the “unskilled” working class who “made up a large share of Sun readers before the disas- ter”. The report said “attitudes towards the EU got significantly more positive in Merseyside during the boycott”. (pressgazette.co.uk) ;The boycott of The Sun was a factor in Merseyside voting Remain in the EU referen- dum. ;People who avoided tabloid media were found to be better informed. ;The most popular choice of people who boy- cotted The Sun was to switch to the Daily Mirror. ;A single media actor can have significant influence on opinion on a particular subject. ;D
Scientists at the University of Dundee found that hunger can significantly alter how people make important decisions and lead to impatience. Hunger may also change preferences for rewards completely unre- lated to food, the study suggested. It was also found to affect other types of decisions such as financial or interpersonal ones. When hungry, people expressed a stronger preference for smaller hypothetical rewards to be given immediately instead of larger ones that would arrive at a later time. Leader of the study Benjamin Vincent said it is important that people know that being hungry can affect their preferences. He also believes it is a danger for those in poverty who may make decisions that entrench their situation. “Say you were going to speak with a pensions or mortgage adviser − doing so while hungry might make you care a bit more about immediate gratification at the expense of a potentially more rosy future.” (Sky News);People who make short-sighted decisions are probably hungry at the time. ;People living in poverty will be unable to escape their position so long as they are hungry. ;Hunger was found to be one of the reasons why people ended up in poverty. ;Being hungry was found to negatively impact a person’s patience. ;D
While the environmental case for going veg- etarian is unequivocal and powerful, the long-term health impacts of adopting a veg- etarian or vegan diet are still poorly under- stood. To help fill the gap, Tammy Tong at the University of Oxford and her colleagues grouped 48,000 people in the UK by diet and followed them over 18 years. The results showed vegetarians had a 22 percent lower risk of heart disease than their meat-eating counterparts. The finding, which is in line with some previous research, could be explained by vegetarians generally having lower cholesterol levels. But the analysis has a sting in the tail: vegetarian diets were also associated with a 20 percent higher risk of stroke than that seen in meat-eaters. The reason could be vegetarians missing out on some nutrients only found in meat, such as the B12 vitamin. But that deficiency can be addressed with supplements, says Tong. (New Scientist) ;The vegan diet is overall the healthiest, the vegetarian the second healthiest, and the meat-eating diet the least healthy. ;Vegans run a lower risk of heart disease than do meat-eaters. ;Vegetarians run a greater risk of a serious medical condition than do meat-eaters. ;Lower cholesterol levels from not eating meat reduce the risk of heart disease. ;C
The number of motorists and cyclists receiv- ing compensation for injuries and damage caused by potholes on London’s main roads has quadrupled in a year. A total of 281 claims — 244 from drivers and 37 from cyclists — were accepted by Transport for London in 2018. Almost £350,000 was paid to cyclists alone in 2018 — taking the total over the past five years paid to cyclists to £1.7 million. The increase in claims follows a controversial decision by TfL commis- sioner Mike Brown to “pause” non-safety- critical road repairs on TfL’s “red route” network for two years to ease a cash crisis. The number of successful claims last year was more than four times the 68 on which TfL paid out in 2017, according to figures obtained by the London Assembly. A total of 571 claims were made in 2018, up from 342 the previous year, just under half of which were successful. TfL was unable to provide a figure for the amount paid to motorists. (Evening Standard);The costs of claims has reduced potential sav- ings from suspending repair works. ;Claims costs are rising because there are more problems with the roads today. ;Less than half the claims made in 2018 were successful. ;More was paid out to cyclists in claims in 2018 than in any of the previous four years. ;A

Russian alcohol consumption decreased by 43% from 2003 to 2016, a World Health Organization (WHO) report says. It attributed the decline to a series of alcohol- control measures implemented under former President Dmitry Medvedev and a push towards healthy lifestyles. The WHO said the drop in alcohol consumption was linked to a significant rise in life expectancy. It noted that Russia had previ- ously been considered one of the heaviest- drinking countries in the world. “Alcohol consumption has long been recognised as one of the main driving factors of mortality in the Russian Federation, especially among men of working age,” the report said. But from 2003 to 2018, alcohol consumption and mortality decreased, with the most signifi- cant changes occurring in causes of death linked to alcohol. In 2018, life expectancy in Russia reached a historic peak, at 68 years for men and 78 years for women. (BBC News) ;Russia formerly led the world in terms of alcohol consumption. ;Alcohol-related deaths unevenly impacted working age men. ;In 2016 Russians drank less than half the alco- hol they did in 2003. ;Russian women have higher life expectancy because they drink less alcohol. ;B
People treated for several days in an inten- sive care unit had their stomachs quickly colonised by harmful pathogens, tests show. Healthier gut microbes were pushed out – a shift that may have long-term effects after someone is discharged. Heavy use of broad- spectrum antibiotics, feeding people through a tube and using a ventilator to help them breathe could all contribute to the effect, say the team who carried out the study. “It’s quite disconcerting,” says Mark Pallen. “I suspected that something like this was going on, but I was quite taken aback at the scale of the changes.” To assess the impact of intensive care treatment on the gut microbiome, the team tracked 24 people admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, UK, over a 10-month period. Two-thirds of the patients showed a marked reduction in microbial diversity at some stage during their stay. The biggest changes were associated with intravenous use of the antibiotic meropenem. (New Scientist);A trip to the hospital has the potential to play havoc with a person’s gut bacteria. ;A person may leave the hospital worse off than before they were admitted. ;Two-thirds of patients left the hospital with a significant reduction in microbial diversity. ;Using antibiotics inevitably reduces micro- bial diversity in the gut. ;A
After surveying more than 6,000 people in the US, Germany, France and the UK, Swiss bank UBS found that 21% had reduced the number of flights they took over the last year due to environmental concerns. Only 16% of British respondents said they were cutting back on flying, but 24% of US trav- ellers were worried enough to change their flying habits. The bank now expects the number of flights in the EU will increase by just 1.5% per year, which is half the rate expected by plane maker Airbus. The bank forecasted that growth in US flights would fall from the 2.1% expected to just 1.3%. And that could have a big impact on aircraft manufacturers. UBS estimates it could reduce the number of smaller planes ordered from Airbus and rival Boeing by 110 each year. The bank said that would reduce revenues at Airbus, which controls around 57% of the market, by around €2.8bn a year.

An experiment in Germany has made the most precise measurement yet of the maxi- mum mass of neutrinos — light subatomic particles that are so devilishly difficult to measure that physicists have only been able to estimate the upper limit of their mass. The first results from the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment in south- western Germany reveal that neutrinos weigh at most 1.1 electronvolts (eV). This measurement is a two-fold improvement over previous upper-bound measurements of 2 eV. Guido Drexlin, co-spokesperson for the KATRIN collaboration, presented the results on 13 September at a conference in Toyama, Japan. Neutrinos are among the most abundant particles in the Universe. They are also the lightest of all the known subatomic particles that have mass — weighing around 500,000 times less than an electron. But they tend to cross matter unde- tected, which makes it extremely challeng- ing to take direct measurements of these particles. (Nature);Neutrinos are the lightest materials in the universe. ;Scientists cannot estimate how light neutri- nos may be. ;Neutrinos make up most of the mass of the universe. ;Neutrinos are difficult to measure because of their small weight. ;B
Emma Garnett and her colleagues at the University of Cambridge collected data on more than 94,000 meals sold in 3 of the cafe- terias at the university in 2017. When the proportion of meatless options doubled from one to two of four choices, overall sales remained about constant. But sales of meat-containing meals dropped, and sales of vegetarian meals rose 40–80%. Increases in plant-based dining were largest among people with the lowest baseline rates of vegetarian-meal consumption. The researchers found no evidence that higher sales of vegetarian dishes at lunch led to lower vegetarian sales at dinner. Other vari- ables that influenced dining choices included the relative prices of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, and the out- door temperature. The authors suggest that an increase in vegetarian options could encourage consumers to move away from meat-heavy diets, potentially reducing greenhouse-gas emissions linked to animal- derived food. (Nature);The lower price of vegetarian meals may have made them a more desirable option. ;Providing better-tasting vegetarian meals saw an increase in their consumption. ;The increasing amount of vegetarian options will have a positive impact on the environ- ment. ;Cafeterias which added a second vegetarian option saw vegetarian sales nearly double. ;A
Demographers study populations to deter- mine their size and composition and to pre- dict how they are likely to change in years to come. In all countries, this knowledge is key to meeting the population’s present and future needs, for example, to decide how many new kindergartens, schools or retire- ment homes are needed. Demographers analyse data collected by the national statis- tical offices and organise surveys on spe- cific themes. To become a demographer, you need a Master’s degree in demography or a related discipline, such as sociology, statis- tics, geography, biology etc. You can also study for a PhD to specialise in research or to teach demography at university level.

In a new study, Penn State researchers found that people who were more sensitive to shifts in negative emotion — quickly moving from a relaxed state to one of fear, for example — were more likely to feel anx- ious while being led through relaxation exercises. Michelle Newman, professor of psychology, said the results could help ben- efit people who experience “relaxation- induced anxiety,” a phenomenon that occurs when people actually become more anxious during relaxation training. “People may be staying anxious to prevent a large shift in anxiety, but it’s actually healthier to let yourself experience those shifts,” Newman said. “The more you do it, the more you realize you can do it and it’s better to allow yourself to be relaxed at times. Mindfulness training and other interventions can help people let go and live in the moment.” (Penn State University) ;People with anxiety may actively resist efforts to calm them down. ;Preventing relaxation for stressed people is healthier in the long run. ;Mindfulness training is the best way to deal with anxiety. ;A large shift in anxiety levels can be harmful to people. ;A
The resource curse is a paradoxical situation in which countries with an abundance of non-renewable natural resources experience stagnant economic growth or even economic contraction. The resource curse occurs as a country begins to focus all of its production means on a single industry, such as mining, and neglects investment in other major sec- tors. As a result, the nation becomes overly dependent on the price of commodities, and overall gross domestic product becomes extremely volatile. Additionally, govern- ment corruption often results when proper resource rights and an income distribution framework are not established in the soci- ety, resulting in unfair regulation of the industry. The resource curse is most often witnessed in emerging markets following a major natural resource discovery. (Investo- pedia) ;The resource curse overwhelmingly affects less democratic countries. ;Revenues from mining are volatile primarily because of fluctuations in demand. ;Focusing on a single resource exposes a coun- try to price fluctuations. ;Government corruption is necessary for the resource curse to occur. ;C
Q fever is an infection caused by the bac- terium Coxiella burnetii. Q fever is usually a mild disease with flu-like symptoms. Many people have no symptoms at all. In a small percentage of people, the infection can resurface years later. This more deadly form of Q fever can damage your heart, liver, brain and lungs. Q fever is transmitted to humans by animals, most commonly sheep, goats and cattle. When you inhale barnyard dust particles contaminated by infected animals, you may become infected. High-risk occupations include farming, vet- erinary medicine and animal research. Mild cases of Q fever clear up quickly with antibiotic treatment. But if Q fever recurs, you may need to take antibiotics for at least 18 months. (mayoclinic.org);An infection that can cause brain damage can often go unnoticed. ;Like chicken pox, Q fever tends only to be dangerous the second time. ;Antibiotics can deal quickly with Q fever. ;Sheep are the animal most likely to pass Q fever on to humans. ;A
Exposure Compensation allows photogra- phers to override exposure settings picked by a camera’s light meter, in order to darken or brighten images before they are captured. Since camera meters work by evaluating light reflected off subjects and are standard- ised on middle grey, any time a camera is pointed at something very dark, the meter will work the opposite way by brightening up the exposure, whereas a very bright sub- ject will cause the meter to darken the expo- sure. This is done in order to get as close to the middle grey as possible, so that the resulting image is not too dark or too bright. While this works out quite well in most cases, one might experience overexposure or underexposure in more challenging light- ing conditions, where the camera meter might be adjusting the exposure too aggres- sively. This is where Exposure Compensation comes into play, with the photographer manually taking control of the brightness of the image and overriding it using the exposure compensation feature of the camera. (photographylife.com) ;Exposure compensation is a setting that is best left to experienced photographers. ;Exposure compensation is only to be used in more challenging lighting conditions. ;Exposure compensation is used because camera light meters are too often unreliable. ;Exposure compensation allows photogra- phers to manipulate an image’s darkness. ;D
The current scientific view of Venus holds that, at some point in the past, the planet had much more water than its bone-dry atmosphere suggests today. But as the Sun grew hotter and brighter, surface tempera- tures rose on Venus, eventually vaporizing any oceans and seas. With ever more water vapor in the atmosphere, the planet entered a runaway greenhouse condition from which it couldn’t recover. Whether Earth- style plate tectonics ever operated on Venus is unknown. Water is critical for plate tec- tonics to operate, and a runaway green- house effect would have effectively shut down that process had it operated there. But the ending of plate tectonics wouldn’t have spelled the end of geological activity: The planet’s considerable internal heat contin- ued to produce magma, which poured out as voluminous lava flows and resurfaced most of the planet. Indeed, the average surface age of Venus is around 700 million years – very old, certainly, but much younger than the multi-billion-year-old surfaces of Mars, Mercury or the Moon. (The Conversation);Venus has the youngest surface of any planet in the solar system. ;Venus is much younger than Mars, Mercury or the Moon. ;It is uncertain if the vaporising of water stopped plate tectonics on Venus. ;As the Sun grew hotter and brighter, it even- tually vaporised Venus. ;C
The number of children who have smoked has fallen to a record low, an NHS survey revealed today. Sixteen percent of secondary school pupils said they had tried cigarettes last year, down from 19 percent two years earlier. This is the lowest level ever recorded by the two-yearly survey and con- tinues the decline from 49 percent in 1996. The percentage of pupils who had ever smoked was similar for boys (16 percent) and girls (17 percent). It increased with age, from two percent of 11-year-olds to 31 per- cent of 15-year-olds. Five percent of 15-year- olds were regular smokers. Rates were lowest in London (three percent) and high- est in Yorkshire and the Humber, at more than seven percent. A quarter of pupils said they had used e-cigarettes, the same as in 2016. (Evening Standard) ;The number of children who have smoked has fallen to the lowest annual level since the survey began. ;It cannot be said that boys were more likely to have smoked than girls. ;There is a good chance that e-cigarettes will eventually reduce smoking among the young.;Current figures are a huge drop from the days when the majority of secondary school pupils smoked. ;B
Researchers at Newcastle University ran tests with full-scale washing machines to show that a delicate wash, which uses up to twice as much water as a standard cycle, releases on average 800,000 more microfi- bres than less water-hungry cycles. “Our findings were a surprise,” said Prof Grant Burgess. “You would expect delicate washes to protect clothes and lead to less microfi- bres being released, but our careful studies showed that in fact it was the opposite. If you wash your clothes on a delicate wash cycle the clothes release far more plastic fibres. These are microplastics, made from polyester. They are not biodegradable and can build up in our environment.” The find- ing challenges the assumption that more aggressive washing cycles, which use less water, change direction more frequently and spin at higher speeds, release more fibres into wastewater. Instead, the volume of water used per wash appears to be the most important factor in dislodging fibres from clothing, the study found. (The Guardian) ;Delicate washes were found to destroy clothes more often than standard cycles. ;Washing machine manufacturers did not properly test how their machines work. ;Standard wash cycles are better for the envi- ronment than delicate cycles. ;The amount of water used had little bearing on the amount of microplastics released. ;C
A new study has suggested that ear infec- tions were responsible for the Neanderthals’ extinction. Today they can be simply treated with modern medicines like antibiotics, but the Neanderthals contracted many complications from ear infections, including respiratory infections, hearing loss and pneumonia. The study found that the ears of Neanderthals were comparable to those of human children and did not change with age, as children’s do. While the shape of a human child’s ear begins to change around the age of five, meaning that they are less likely to contract ear infections, this did not happen with Neanderthals, the study found. “It’s not just the threat of dying of an infection,” Prof. Samuel Marquez said. “If you are constantly ill, you would not be as fit and effective in compet- ing with your Homo sapien cousins for food and other resources.” He added: “In a world of survival of the fittest, it is no wonder that modern man, not Neanderthal, prevailed.” (The Independent);Complications from ear infections are what killed off the Neanderthals. ;Modern humans do not have ears shaped like those of Neanderthals. ;Neanderthals were doomed because they failed to evolve. ;Neanderthals’ ears appear to have predis- posed them to becoming ill. ;D
"After taking other related factors into account, a new study has revealed that living in large towns and cities near to England’s coastline is linked with better mental health for those in the lowest earn- ing households. Approximately one in six adults in England suffer from mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression, and these are far more likely in people from poorer backgrounds. The findings suggest that access to the coast could help to reduce these health inequalities in towns and cities close to the sea. The research used data from the Health Survey for England and com- pared people’s health to their proximity to the coast; from those living less than 1km away, to those more than 50km away. Its findings add to the growing evidence that access to blue spaces—particularly coastal environments—might improve health and wellbeing. (University of Exeter) ";The study showed there is something to be said about the benefits of sea breezes. ;The poor near the coast had better mental health than richer people further inland. ;The study adds to the growing evidence of the benefits of having access to green spaces.;It cannot be said that proximity to the coast was linked with better mental health for the wealthy. ;D
The Sahm Rule was invented by Federal Reserve economist Claudia Sahm to flag the onset of recessions more quickly than the current process. It also aims to be more dependable than some of the financial market metrics known to throw off false signals. Sahm said the unemployment rate can cut through all that. It is a widely used and easily understood statistic that captures why recessions matter. It also turns out that when the three-month average unemploy- ment rate rises half a percentage point above the low of the previous year, the econ- omy has just or is about to enter a period of contraction. It has happened every time since the 1970s, Sahm noted in recommend- ing her rule be used as a way to automati- cally trigger stimulus payments to households to help offset the sting of rising joblessness and potentially shorten the recession without waiting for politicians to sort through the data and vote on a stimulus package. (Reuters) ;The Sahm Rule is a widely adopted and easy to understand statistic. ;The Sahm Rule is intended to be a more reli- able indicator of an upcoming recession. ;The Sahm Rule is more reliable than some of the metrics the financial market uses. ;The Sahm Rule is going to be used to auto- matically trigger stimulus payments to households. ;B
Sleep deprivation combined with long haul trips are a common cause of truck accidents. A new report suggests truck drivers across Europe are more likely to succumb to obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) as a result of not getting enough shut eye and living a sedentary lifestyle on the road. Obesity is a main risk factor of OSA. Over 70% of partic- ipants in a study by the European Lung Foundation were reported to be overweight and as a result had sleep-related breathing problems. Between 30-50% of road acci- dents in Germany are caused by truck drivers who fall asleep momentarily at the wheel, the Intersom Cologne Center for Sleep, Medicine and Research reports. These are the most serious accidents, Hans- Günter Weess remarks, because “the driver doesn't realise what is happening and cannot react. Deadly accidents due to sleep deprivation happen quite frequently — per- haps twice as often as accidents as a result of drunk driving.” (Deutsche Welle);It cannot be said that a majority of road acci- dents in Germany are caused by truck drivers falling asleep. ;Accidents caused by drivers falling asleep are more frequent but less serious than those caused by drunk drivers. ;People with sleep-related breathing problems are likely to be overweight. ;It cannot be said that sleep-deprived drivers caused more deadly road accidents than drunk drivers. ;A
A Korean study suggests that people who flush after drinking could be more vulnera- ble to the harmful effects of alcohol on blood pressure. The study compared the risk of high blood pressure in men who flush after consuming alcohol, compared with “non-flushers”. It found that when “flushers” have more than four drinks a week their risk of high blood pressure was increased to a potentially hazardous level. While in non-flushers the risk only increased when they had more than eight drinks weekly. Researchers speculate that “flushers” may have a faulty version of a gene ALDH2, which, when working, breaks down a substance in alcohol called acetalde- hyde. And it could be excess amounts of acetaldehyde that is causing both facial flushing and high blood pressure. However, a causal relationship between the two remains unproven. It would also be danger- ous to conclude that, if you are not a flusher, you can happily booze with impunity. (National Health Service) ;“Non-flushers” can have up to eight alcoholic drinks a week without health risks. ;Women “flushers” were found to be at greater risk than men “non-flushers”. ;An inability to break down acetaldehyde may carry greater risks for high blood pres- sure. ;Excess amounts of acetaldehyde are what cause facial flushing and high blood pres- sure. ;C
An ARkStorm (for Atmospheric River 1,000 Storm) is a hypothetical but scientifically realistic “megastorm” scenario developed and published by the Multi Hazards Demonstration Project of the United States Geological Survey, based on historical occurrences. It describes an extreme storm that could devastate much of California, causing up to $725 billion in losses (mostly caused by flooding), and affect a quarter of California's homes. The event would be similar to exceptionally intense California storms that occurred between December 1861 and January 1862, which dumped nearly 10 feet of rain in parts of California, over a period of 43 days. The name “ARkStorm” means “Atmospheric River (AR) 1,000 (k)” as the storm was originally projected as a 1-in-1000-year event. However, more recent geologic data sug- gests that the actual frequency of the event is likely in the 100- to 200-year range. (Wikipedia);ARkStorms are known to occur about every 100 to 200 years. ;It would be wrong to think that ARkStorms are merely a wild theory. ;An ARkStorm would leave most of California underwater. ;An ARkStorm is less likely to occur in the neighbouring desert state of Arizona. ;B
Middle-aged adults who walk slowly are likely to have brains and bodies that have aged prematurely, researchers announced. They found that the walking speed of 45- year-olds was associated with physical and biological indicators of “accelerated aging”. Walking speed was already a well-known indicator of functional decline and mortal- ity in the elderly, but this is the first study to link it with midlife health. Senior author Professor Terrie Moffitt said: “Doctors know that slow walkers in their 70s and 80s tend to die sooner than fast walkers their same age. But this study found that a slow walk is a problem sign decades before old age.” The study of 45-year-olds found those who had the fastest walking speeds were in the best health. Those who registered the slowest speeds tended to have lower total brain volume and lower average cortical thickness, an indicator of neurodegenera- tive and psychiatric disorders. (Evening Standard) ;Slow walkers were found to have neurode- generative and psychiatric disorders. ;A person’s walking speed is inversely related to how their aging is progressing. ;A child’s walking speed can determine how they will age later in life. ;Slow walkers in their 70s and 80s will die sooner than fast walkers. ;B

Glaucoma is a common eye condition where the optic nerve, which connects the eye to the brain, becomes damaged. It's usually caused by fluid building up in the front part of the eye, which increases pressure inside the eye. Glaucoma can lead to loss of vision if it's not diagnosed and treated early. It can affect people of all ages, but is most common in adults in their 70s and 80s. Glaucoma does not usually cause any symp- toms to begin with. It tends to develop slowly over many years and affects the edges of your vision (peripheral vision) first. For this reason, many people do not realise they have glaucoma, and it's often only picked up during a routine eye test. If you do notice any symptoms, they might include blurred vision, or seeing rainbow- coloured circles around bright lights. Both eyes are usually affected, although it may be worse in 1 eye. (National Health Service);If a person makes it to their 90s without developing glaucoma, they probably will not develop it at all. ;Once glaucoma affects peripheral vision, it is already too advanced to reverse. ;Fluid building up in the front part of the eye is occasionally the cause of glaucoma. ;The danger with glaucoma is that many people are unaware they are developing it. ;D
Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pres- sure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs (pulmonary arteries). It's a serious condition that can damage the right side of the heart. The walls of the pulmonary arter- ies become thick and stiff, and can't expand as well to allow blood through. The reduced blood flow makes it harder for the right- hand side of the heart to pump blood through the arteries. If the right-hand side of your heart has to continually work harder, it can gradually become weaker. This can lead to heart failure. Pulmonary hypertension is a rare condition that can affect people of all ages, but it's more common in people who have another heart or lung condition. (National Health Service) ;Pulmonary hypertension essentially leads to heart fatigue, which can cause death. ;It cannot be said that pulmonary hyperten- sion primarily affects the elderly. ;It is rare for someone to have pulmonary hypertension without other conditions. ;Pulmonary hypertension primarily affects the right side of the heart. ;A
Exercising for 30 minutes four times a week may delay brain deterioration in people likely to develop Alzheimer’s, scientists have shown. Researchers from the University of Texas found that people who had an accumulation of amyloid beta protein in the brain − an early sign that Alzheimer's disease is on the way − experienced slower degeneration in a region of the brain crucial for memory if they exercised regularly for one year. Scientists say the findings suggest that aerobic workouts can at least slow down the effects of the disease if intervention occurs in the early stages. “What are you sup- posed to do if you have amyloid clumping together in the brain? Right now, doctors can't prescribe anything,” said Dr Rong Zhang. “If these findings can be replicated in a larger trial, then maybe one day doctors will be telling high-risk patients to start an exercise plan. In fact, there's no harm in doing so now.” (The Telegraph) ;Exercising for 20 minutes six times a week may delay brain deterioration. ;It cannot be said that the researchers deter- mined that exercise can slow the effects of Alzheimer’s. ;Workouts at high intensity are more effective than gentle exercise. ;It cannot be said that the researchers think exercise may be a useful treatment for early Alzheimer’s. ;B
“When the moon is low in the sky,” astronomer Bob Berman says, “It is farther away from you than when it is directly over- head. Because of this, the light that's being reflected off of a horizon-hugging moon has to travel a farther distance—and through more particles of air—to reach your eyes. By the time we perceive this light, the shorter wavelengths of light, the 'blue' ones, have been scattered by the air, leaving only the longer wavelengths, the 'red' ones, to reach our eyes,” he said. “Thus, to us, the bluish hues are filtered out, and the moon takes on an orange tinge!” On the other hand, when the moon is directly overhead, the light does not have to travel through as many air particles to reach us because the moon is closer, thus it is scattered less. This enables more of the blue wavelengths to reach our eyes, lending the moon a brighter, less orangey color. (Newsweek) ;Shorter wavelengths do not travel through the atmosphere as well as longer ones. ;The moon appears larger on the horizon because of the way light waves are scattered. ;It cannot be said that the colour of the moon is more accurately observed when it is over- head. ;The moon appears smaller when it is closer because you can see the shorter light waves. ;A
Astronomers have spotted hints of water raining in the atmosphere of an exoplanet. Named K2-18 b, the planet is not much bigger than Earth and is located 34 parsecs (110 light years) away. Researchers pushed the limits of the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes to observe how the light from K2-18 b’s star filtered through the planet’s atmosphere, revealing signs that water vapour was condensing into liquid water. Of course, the presence of water in the atmosphere of an Earth-size planet doesn’t necessarily mean the world also has life: just look at Venus. (Nature);Astronomers have spotted water droplets on an exoplanet far away. ;It’s possible that a distant planet has more rainwater than planet Earth. ;The planet is unlikely to have life, just as is the case for Venus. ;A planet needs to be Earth-sized for it to have water in its atmosphere. ;B
The 1992 Framingham Heart Study, which still stands as the gold standard for long- term health studies, tracked workers over 20 years. It found that “men who don't take vacations were 30% more likely to have a heart attack and for women it went up to 50%,” according to Brigid Schulte. Those numbers hold true even after researchers took into account other health factors like diabetes, cigarette smoking, income levels and obesity. The conclusions from the study have been backed up by other similar research studies. “It shows how the body reacts to a lifestyle of stress. This is real evi- dence that vacations are important to your physical health,” Elaine Eaker, a co-author of the study, told the New York Times. (CNN Travel) ;An annual vacation is enough to reduce stress and improve health. ;It cannot be said that women were affected more by not having vacations. ;Heart attack risk rates were found to be the same even when adjusting for exercise. ;It cannot be said that not taking vacations affected men and women equally. ;D
Instances of rain—not to mention typhoons, flooding or heat—stopping play in sports are likely to become more common as cli- mate change makes some weather events more severe. In the case of storms such as Typhoon Hagibis, a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapour, which makes them more intense. 2018 saw more natural disasters than any year going back to 1980, according to Munich Re, a reinsurer. In the future, coastal regions will become more prone to storms and flooding, while inland regions will face heatwaves and flash flood- ing, according to Piers Forster, a professor of climate physics. A study in 2016 found that over the past 40 years, Asian typhoons such as the one that hit Japan have become 50% stronger. The tropical storms hitting America are becoming more potent, too. When it comes to sporting events, Mr Forster points out, “nowhere is safe.” (The Economist);The typhoons that strike Asian countries are more potent than the tropical storms that hit America. ;Storms such as the one that hit Japan have become half as strong over the past 40 years. ;Asian typhoons have become stronger faster than tropical storms that hit America. ;It cannot be said that all weather events are becoming more severe with climate change. ;D
A new study published in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine found smoking just a handful of cigarettes per day causes lung damage similar to smoking more than a pack per day. Having fewer than five cigarettes per day was associated with about two-thirds as much lung damage as puffing on 30 or more cigarettes per day, according to the study. Put another way, a light smoker could expect to lose about as much lung function in a year as a heavy smoker would in nine months. Study co-author Dr. Elizabeth Oelsner says that the finding should dissuade people from taking up any amount of smoking—but it shouldn’t dis- courage current smokers from reducing their daily cigarette use. Doing so can be an important step toward quitting entirely, and can come with significant health benefits. (Time) ;Halving their cigarette consumption won’t make a big difference to heavy smokers’ risk of lung damage. ;Light smoking was found to cause just as much lung damage as heavy smoking. ;Those who cut back their smoking are more likely to eventually quit entirely. ;Doctors said there was not much to be gained from cutting back cigarette consumption. ;A
"Despite their shortcomings, impact factors continue to be a primary means by which academics “quantify the quality of science”. One side effect of impact factors is the incentive they create for editors to coerce authors to add citations to their journal. Coercive self-citation does not refer to the normal citation directions, given during a peer-review process, meant to improve a paper. Coercive self-citation refers to requests that give no indication that the manuscript was lacking in attribution; make no suggestion as to specific articles, authors, or a body of work requiring review; and only guide authors to add citations from the editor's journal. This quote from an editor as a condition for publication highlights the problem: “you cite Leukemia [once in 42 references]. Consequently, we kindly ask you to add references of articles published in Leukemia to your present arti- cle”. Gentler language may be used, but the message is clear: Add citations or risk rejec- tion. (Science Magazine)";Impact factors are not a good method for quantifying the quality of science.;Academic articles were generally found to include unnecessary citations. ;Coercive citations occur when journal editors ask authors to add more citations or risk rejection. ;In order to be published, some articles may need to include superfluous citations. ;D
A new study has found that “cartilage in human joints can repair itself through a pro- cess similar to that used by creatures such as salamanders and zebrafish to regenerate limbs”. These findings could open the door to new treatments for joint injuries and dis- eases like osteoarthritis -- and perhaps even lead to human limb regeneration one day. Scientists have known for years that humans do have some regenerative capabilities -- when children's fingertips are amputated, the tip can regenerate when treated correctly. But it was widely believed that these capa- bilities were limited, and that humans were “unable to counteract cumulative damage” to their joints, the study said − which these new findings disprove. This has potentially huge implications for athletes or people with joint injuries. MicroRNA could be injected into joints or developed into medicines that pre- vent or reverse arthritis, the study said. In the more distant future, it could even “establish a basis for human limb regeneration.” (CNN Health) ;The study found new treatments for repair- ing joint injuries. ;The study has opened the door to human limb generation. ;Humans already have some limited abilities to regenerate. ;Human cartilage repairs itself the same way as salamanders regenerate limbs. ;C
Scientists found that openness to experi- ence — a trait related to greater curiosity and imagination — stood out as separating politicians who won elections from those who lost. Candidates with greater openness were less likely to win their seat, and on average those who won scored 0.24 points lower on the seven-point openness scale. So even though higher openness to experience was associated with running for election, amongst candidates it was related to a reduced chance of winning. Why might that be? The trait is associated with holding left- wing views, so politicians who score higher could alienate right-leaning voters — though the researchers didn’t find that the “penalty” of greater openness was any worse in traditionally conservative areas. Another possibility is that people who are particularly open to new ideas are just not that great at sticking to their political mes- sages — and consistency in messaging is important to voters. (British Psychological Society) ;People with higher levels of openness to experience hold left-wing views. ;Politicians who lack imagination are better at winning elections. ;People who are open to experience have dif- ficulty staying on message. ;The less open to experience a particular can- didate is, the better their chances of victory. ;B
Teenagers are less likely to use cannabis in places where the drug has been legalised, a new study suggests. While overall use among US youth went up between 1993 and 2017, the likelihood of teen use declined by nearly 10% in states where recreational use was legalised. Lead study author Mark Anderson said that the study “should help to quell some concerns that use among teens will actually go up”. Dr Anderson said it was usually harder for teens to buy from licensed dispensaries − where proof of age is required − than from dealers, which could partly explain the drop. Cannabis sold in dispensaries is also often more expensive. Dr Anderson said that the researchers did not find a change after medical cannabis was legalised − only when the drug was legalised for recreational purposes. (BBC News);Among teenagers it was legalising recre- ational, not medical, cannabis that made the difference. ;The price of cannabis became too expensive for teens after legalisation. ;It cannot be said that legalising cannabis is the solution to ending teen use. ;Where cannabis is legal, it loses its cool factor, leading to less use. ;A
In astronomy, the barycentre is the centre of mass of two or more bodies that orbit one another and is the point about which the bodies orbit. If one of two orbiting bodies is much more massive than the other and the bodies are relatively close to one another, the barycentre will typically be located within the more massive object. In this case, rather than the two bodies appearing to orbit a point between them, the less massive body will appear to orbit about the more massive body, while the more massive body might be observed to wobble slightly. When the two bodies are of similar masses, the barycentre will generally be located between them and both bodies will orbit around it. When the less massive object is far away, the barycentre can be located out- side the more massive object. (Wikipedia) ;The barycentre of Jupiter's orbit is outside the Sun. ;A barycentre outside a celestial object means the distance is huge. ;It cannot be said that an object orbits around the centre of another.;The Earth's orbit causes a slight wobble in the Sun. ;C
It has been argued that an interstellar mis- sion that cannot be completed within 50 years should not be started at all. Instead, assuming that a civilization is still on an increasing curve of propulsion system velocity and not yet having reached the limit, the resources should be invested in designing a better propulsion system. This is because a slow spacecraft would probably be passed by another mission sent later with more advanced propulsion (the inces- sant obsolescence postulate). On the other hand, Andrew Kennedy has shown that if one calculates the journey time to a given destination as the rate of travel speed derived from growth (even exponential growth) increases, there is a clear minimum in the total time to that destination from now. Voyages undertaken before the mini- mum will be overtaken by those that leave at the minimum, whereas voyages that leave after the minimum will never overtake those that left at the minimum. (Wikipedia);A spacecraft launched today will be over- taken by one launched in 25 years. ;It is increasingly accepted that interstellar missions that cannot be completed in 50 years should not be started. ;Not enough resources are spent on improv- ing propulsion systems. ;So long as technology is rapidly improving, newer missions may overtake older ones. ;D
Researchers asked 76 female undergrads (half of them were diagnosed with depres- sion) to listen to various classical music clips. The scientists found that, like in a 2015 study, participants with depression indicated they would rather listen to sad music than happy music. Then, the researchers gave the participants new clips of happy and sad instrumental music and asked them to describe how the tracks made them feel. Again, the depressed participants preferred the sad music, but they also stated that the sad music made them feel happier. “They actually were feeling better after lis- tening to this sad music than they were before,” study co-author Jonathan Rottenberg said. It seemed to have relaxing and calming effects. This challenges the assumption that sad people listen to sad music to make themselves feel worse, when, in fact, it may be a coping mechanism. (The Verge) ;Happy music has no impact on making people feel better. ;There is reason to believe that sad music makes the depressed feel better. ;Depressed people preferred sad music since it would not cheer them up. ;Vocal sad music was not found to have bene- fits like instrumental music. ;B
The US has fallen behind several countries around the world in terms of educational mobility and university-level educational attainment. The number of young people attending and graduating from university has in the past surpassed the numbers of the previous generation. Today, however, that is not always true, and fewer young adults are getting a higher education than their par- ents. Several factors contribute to this trend. One of the biggest reasons that fewer indi- viduals are going to university is the cost. Tuition costs at public universities have drastically increased over the last few decades, leading to less equitable access to education. This indicates that those from lower socioeconomic classes have a more difficult time paying for and attending uni- versity. (worldatlas.com) ;It cannot be said that the rise in tuition fees has been felt evenly across society. ;The United States formerly led the world in terms of university education attainment. ;The cost of tuition is the biggest reason why less people are going to university. ;Despite a recent drop, more are going to uni- versity today than in their parents’ time. ;A
Auto-brewery syndrome or gut fermenta- tion syndrome is a condition in which ethanol is produced through endogenous fermentation by fungi or bacteria in the gas- trointestinal system. Patients with auto- brewery syndrome present with many of the signs and symptoms of alcohol intoxica- tion while denying an intake of alcohol and often report a high-sugar, high-carbohy- drate diet. The production of endogenous ethanol occurs in minute quantities as part of normal digestion, but when fermenting yeast or bacteria become pathogenic, extreme blood alcohol levels may result. Auto-brewery syndrome is more prevalent in patients with co-morbidities such as dia- betes, obesity, and Crohn disease, but can occur in otherwise healthy individuals. Several strains of fermenting yeasts and rare bacteria are identified as the pathogens. While auto-brewery syndrome is rarely diagnosed, it is probably underdiagnosed. (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov);Auto-brewery syndrome is most commonly linked to diabetes. ;Everyone produces alcohol in their system as a normal part of digestion. ;People with auto-brewery syndrome pro- duce methanol in their digestive system. ;Auto-brewery syndrome is inconvenient, but not potentially dangerous. ;B
In a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a team of scientists showed that socioeconomic advantage can be mapped by wastewater. Specifically, the wastewater from wealthier communities where people had higher educational achievement showed higher levels of vitamins, citrus, and fibre, while the waste from poorer com- munities where people were generally less educated showed higher levels of prescrip- tion pain relievers and antidepressant med- ications. “Although [wastewater-based epidemiology] has primarily been used for measuring drug consumption, our results demonstrate that it can be used to identify sociodemographic patterns or disparities which associate with consumption of spe- cific chemicals or food components,” the team wrote. (inverse.com) ;It cannot be said that higher educational achievement was associated with a better diet. ;A correlation between prescription pain reliever use and less education appears to exist. ;People who took anti-depressants did so because of their socioeconomic status. ;It cannot be said that the study of wastewater can be used to indicate school attainment pat- terns. ;B
The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines gaming disorder as a pattern of gaming behaviour characterised by “impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given to gaming over other activi- ties to the extent that gaming takes prece- dence over other interests and daily activities, and continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences”. The decision to classify gaming disorder as a mental health condi- tion for the first time was heavily criticised by leading video game firms, who argued the move was not based on sufficiently robust evidence and created a risk of misdi- agnosis for patients. Neuroscientist Nastasia Griffioen recently warned of the dangers of stigmatising people as being addicted to video games. “If we do stigma- tise people basically as being addicted to video games, we might take away those video games when they might be a coping mechanism for a deeper, underlying prob- lem like depression or anxiety”, she said. (videogameschronicle.com);Video game makers oppose classification of a gaming disorder due to potential loss of prof- its. ;Video games are a coping mechanism for other underlying problems. ;The decision to classify a video game disor- der caused widespread controversy. ;Something that has been classified as a mental health condition might just be a coping mechanism. ;D
"The Roche limit is the distance within which a celestial body, held together only by its own force of gravity, will disintegrate due to a second celestial body's tidal forces exceeding the first body's gravitational self- attraction. Inside the Roche limit, orbiting material disperses and forms rings whereas outside the limit material tends to coalesce. Typically, the Roche limit applies to a satel- lite's disintegrating due to tidal forces induced by its primary, the body about which it orbits. Parts of the satellite that are closer to the primary are attracted more strongly by gravity from the primary than parts that are farther away; this disparity effectively pulls the near and far parts of the satellite apart from each other, and if the disparity (combined with any centrifugal effects due to the object's spin) is larger than the force of gravity holding the satel- lite together, it can pull the satellite apart. (Wikipedia) ";Saturn’s rings were created by a moon that fell inside the Roche limit. ;A larger planet’s gravity is enough to pull a satellite apart. ;A satellite can create tidal forces that rip it apart. ;The Roche limit applies when an object’s own gravitational pull is weaker than tidal forces. ;D
"Tidal heating occurs through tidal friction processes: orbital energy is dissipated as heat in either the surface ocean or interior of a planet or satellite. When an object is in an elliptical orbit, the tidal forces acting on it are stronger near periapsis than near apoap- sis. Thus, the deformation of the body due to tidal forces (i.e. the tidal bulge) varies over the course of its orbit, generating inter- nal friction which heats its interior. This energy gained by the object comes from its gravitational energy, so over time in a two- body system, the initial elliptical orbit decays into a circular orbit (tidal circulariza- tion). Sustained tidal heating occurs when the elliptical orbit is prevented from circu- larizing due to additional gravitational forces from other bodies that keep tugging the object back into an elliptical orbit. In this more complex system, gravitational energy still is being converted to thermal energy; however, now the orbit's semimajor axis would shrink rather than its eccentric- ity. (Wikipedia) ";Tidal heating occurs due to the erratic nature of tidal forces. ;Tidal heating can be sustained when an orbit becomes circular. ;An elliptical orbit is necessary for tidal heat- ing. ;Tidal heating is most intense at the periapsis of the orbit. ;C
Synaesthesia is a neurological condition in which the stimulation of one sensory or cog- nitive pathway (for example, hearing) leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway (such as vision). Simply put, when one sense is activated, another unrelated sense is acti- vated at the same time. This may, for instance, take the form of hearing music and simultaneously sensing the sound as swirls or patterns of colour. The most common type of synaesthesia is grapheme- colour synaesthesia, in which individual letters and numbers are associated with spe- cific colours and sometimes colourful pat- terns. Some synesthetes perceive texture in response to sight, hear sounds in response to smells, or associate shapes with flavours. Many synesthetes have more than one type of synaesthesia. It is estimated that approxi- mately 3 to 5 percent of the population has some form of synaesthesia, and the condi- tion can run in families. (Psychology Today);Synaesthesia is a hereditary neurological con- dition. ;Although any sense can trigger it, synaesthe- sia only produces visual responses. ;The majority of synaesthesia cases are visual. ;Smelling sounds would be one form of synaesthesia. ;D
In a recent study, 85% of respondents believed that their mothers had a favourite among their siblings. The finding chimes with many years of research about parental favouritism, which has found that many parents admit to having a favourite child. Dig a little deeper, though, and it turns out that most favouritism has less to do with love and more to do with like: the same par- ents say that they love their children equally, but that one child’s personality res- onates more with them than those of their siblings. (The Guardian) ;Eighty-five percent of study respondents thought their parents had a favourite child. ;Parents may show favouritism towards a child even when they love all of their kids equally. ;Eighty-five percent of mothers had a favourite among their children. ;Studies have shown that most parents do in fact have a favourite child. ;B
A new study from Northwestern University found that toddlers with fewer spoken words have more frequent and severe temper tantrums than their peers with typi- cal language skills. It is the first study to link toddlers’ delayed vocabulary with severe temper tantrums, including children as young as 12 months old, which is much younger than many clinicians typically believe problematic behaviour can be iden- tified. Similarly, both irritability and lan- guage delays are risk factors for later language and learning disorders, co-princi- pal investigator Elizabeth Norton said. About 40% of delayed talkers will go on to have persistent language problems that can affect their academic performance, Norton said. This is why assessing both language and mental health risk in tandem may accel- erate earlier identification and intervention for early childhood disorders because chil- dren with this “double whammy” are likely to be higher risk. (news.northwestern.edu);Half of delayed talkers will go on to have per- sistent language problems later in life. ;Children with mental health risks are more likely to have delayed language skills. ;The study explored the established link between temper tantrums and delayed talk- ing. ;Many clinicians do not believe problematic behaviour can be identified in young tod- dlers. ;D
Children born during the summer are more likely to suffer depression than their fellow pupils, a study has revealed for the first time. The youngest children in the academic school year are 30 percent more likely to develop mental health problems. Scientists used electronic GP records for a sample of one million school-aged children in the UK and found children born in the last three months of the school year were prone to being 30% more likely to develop depres- sion compared to those born in the first three months. Dr Joseph Hayes, co-author of the study and clinical research fellow con- sultant, at University College London, said: “It makes sense that as a child, if you’re comparing yourself to someone a year older, even something as simple as kicking a foot- ball − the difference in size between a four- year-old and a five-year-old is stark, so it’s most likely similar for mental development. Teachers also have expectations of certain behaviours.” (The Telegraph) ;Children born in the first three months of the school year do not usually suffer from depression. ;Being born in autumn has some advantages. ;Younger children should be held back a year to improve their mental well-being. ;The youngest children in a school year were frequently found to develop mental health problems. ;B
Whether napping during the daytime is healthy or unhealthy is unclear. Some previ- ous studies found a reduced risk of heart and circulation problems, while others found a higher risk. A study of 3,462 Swiss adults aimed to see whether the number of naps a week, and the length of time spent napping, could explain the conflicting results. While researchers found no link between length of naps and heart or circula- tion problems, they found that 1 or 2 naps might reduce risks, but having more than 1 or 2 naps did not reduce risk. Sleeping in the daytime on most days could be a sign of a health problem, such as sleep apnoea, which disrupts night-time sleep. (National Health Service) ;It may be the case that people who take more frequent naps have other problems. ;Frequent sleeping during the daytime is a sign of a more serious health problem. ;It cannot be said that there is a lack of a con- sensus on the healthiness of daytime nap- ping. ;Taking more than 1 or 2 naps a week was found to increase heart and circulation risks. ;A
Researchers asked more than 450,000 adults from 10 European countries about their con- sumption of soft drinks. Soft drinks included sugary and artificially sweetened fizzy drinks such as cola as well as diluted cordial. The researchers followed up with the participants for an average of 16 years and found that people who drank 2 or more glasses of any type of soft drink a day were 17% more likely to have died during the study, compared to people who drank less than 1 soft drink a month. Sugary drinks were linked to deaths from digestive dis- eases (such as liver disease), while artifi- cially sweetened drinks were linked to deaths from cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease. While the link between sugar consumption and health problems is well established, it is unclear why artificially sweetened drinks could have an adverse effect on health. (National Health Service) ;Researchers found that the longer they stud- ied a person, the more health issues they had. ;Artificially sweetened drinks were found to be just as bad as sugary drinks. ;;The study compared frequent soft drink drinkers to those who generally abstained from them.;C
Matthew Gallagher led a study that exam- ined the role of hope in predicting recovery in a clinical trial of 223 adults in cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for one of four common anxiety disorders: social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxi- ety disorder and obsessive-compulsive dis- order. “In reviewing recovery during CBT among the diverse clinical presentations, hope was a common element and a strong predictor of recovery,” said Gallagher who reports that moderate-to-large increases in hope and changes in hope were consistent across the five separate CBT treatment pro- tocols. In terms of psychotherapy, hope rep- resents the capacity of patients to identify strategies or pathways to achieve goals and the motivation to effectively pursue those pathways. Significantly, the results of this study indicate that hope gradually increases during the course of CBT, and increases in hope were greater for those in active treat- ment than for those in the waitlist compari- son. (uh.edu) ;Feelings of hopelessness were found to be strongest among the sufferers from panic dis- order. ;Patients without a change in their hope levels were not expected to recover. ;Sufferers from panic disorder got more hope- ful once treatment started. ;Hope was found to promptly increase during the course of cognitive behavioural therapy. ;C
People with long-term health conditions are 20 percent more likely to suffer from pain on days that are humid and windy with low atmospheric pressure according to new research from University of Manchester sci- entists. According to the research, the most important factor associated with worsening pain is high relative humidity. Using a smartphone app developed by healthcare software company uMotif, participants recorded daily symptoms while the local weather was determined from location data provided by the smartphone’s GPS. Humid days were most likely to be painful, whereas dry days were least likely to be painful. Low pressure and higher wind speed were also linked to more painful days, although to a lesser extent than humidity. Despite many people believing pain to be influenced by temperature, there was no association observed, when aver- aged across the population. That said, cold days that were also damp and windy could be more painful. Rainfall was not associ- ated with pain. (manchester.ac.uk);A cold and windy day is worse for pain than a warm day with low atmospheric pressure. ;Most cold days result in more pain in people with long-term health conditions. ;A cold and dry day causes less pain than a warm and damp one. ;Days that are dry are when patients will not experience pain from humidity. ;C
A recent study has identified a new marker for autism that could facilitate earlier diag- nosis. The marker is a difference in the autistic brain’s capacity for binocular rivalry, which describes the visual cortex’s ability to process one image at a time when presented with multiple images at once. The brain’s inability to ignore one of several competing stimuli is tied to the hypersensi- tivity to sensory input that is characteristic of autism. Autistic participants were much less able to toggle their focus between the two images, compared to neurotypical par- ticipants. Amazingly, the researchers found that the rate of binocular rivalry they mea- sured was predictive of the severity of one’s symptoms, and using the data they could diagnose autism in study participants with 87% accuracy. A clear benefit of this study is that this marker is non-verbal, which means it can be used to evaluate young children who have not started talking yet as well as non-verbal adults. (massivesci.com) ;Even if it doesn’t prove to be the most accu- rate method of diagnosis, binocular rivalry has a potential benefit. ;Binocular rivalry is better for diagnosing autism than assessments using language. ;The study showed that people without autism did not have binocular rivalry. ;The rate of binocular rivalry was inversely related to the severity of a person’s symp- toms. ;A
A study examined the long-term impact of co-authorship with established, highly- cited scientists on the careers of junior researchers in four scientific disciplines. Using matched pair analysis, it found that junior researchers who co-author work with top scientists enjoy a persistent competitive advantage throughout the rest of their careers, compared to peers with similar early career profiles but without top co- authors. Such early co-authorship predicts a higher probability of repeatedly co-author- ing work with top-cited scientists, and, ulti- mately, a higher probability of becoming one. Junior researchers affiliated with less prestigious institutions show the most ben- efits from co-authorship with a top scientist. As a consequence, it can be argued that such institutions may hold vast amounts of untapped potential, which may be realised by improving access to top scientists. (Nature) ;;The study found that who you write with is more important than what you write. ;Junior researchers who co-author with estab- lished names will themselves become estab- lished ;Some junior researchers enjoy an unfair com- petitive advantage. ;B
Our hands touch all sort of things during the course of the day, and we don't always have the opportunity to wash them. If you bite your fingernails, you're constantly ingesting microorganisms, and that can have consequences. Nail-biters get colds, gastrointestinal infections and skin rashes more frequently. Your teeth and oral cavity can suffer as well, because pathogens can also establish themselves there. If you gnaw your nails down to below the quick, it can lead to bleeding and damage the nail bed. Constantly open wounds on your fingers can also become infected. In addition, nail biters often suffer psychologically. They feel stigmatized and hide their fingers because they're embarrassed. Many people think chewed fingernails are a sign of being weak-willed and lacking self-discipline. (Deutsche Welle) ;Biting one’s nails will lead to catching a cold or gastrointestinal infection. ;Chewed fingernails are a sign of weak willpower and a lack of self-control. ;It cannot be said that nail biters are stigma- tized because of their behaviour. ;A distressing habit can result in problems with the digestive system. ;D
On a scale from 0 (“not satisfied at all”) to 10 (“fully satisfied”), the mean (average) life satisfaction of EU residents aged 16 and over was 7.3 in 2018, an increase compared with 7.0 in 2013. Since 2013, the mean level of satisfaction with the financial situation of their own household in the EU also increased, from 6.0 in 2013 to 6.5 in 2018, whilst the mean satisfaction with personal relations remained nearly stable, 7.8 in 2013 and 7.9 in 2018. In 2018, the mean life satis- faction varied significantly between EU Member States. With an overall average of 8.1, inhabitants of Finland were the most satisfied with their lives in the EU, closely followed by those in Austria (8.0), Denmark, Poland and Sweden (all 7.8). At the opposite end of the scale, residents in Bulgaria (5.4) were by far the least satisfied, followed by those in Croatia (6.3), Greece and Lithuania (both 6.4), Hungary (6.5), Latvia and Portugal (both 6.7).

Whiplash is a neck injury due to forceful, rapid back-and-forth movement of the neck, like the cracking of a whip. Whiplash most often occurs during a rear-end auto accident, but the injury can also result from a sports accident, physical abuse or other trauma. Common signs and symptoms of whiplash include neck pain, stiffness and headaches. Most people with whiplash get better within a few weeks by following a treat- ment plan that includes pain medication and exercise. However, some people have chronic neck pain and other long-lasting complications. Whiplash may be called a neck sprain or strain, but these terms also include other types of neck injuries. (Mayo Clinic);Whiplash occurs when the neck is propelled very suddenly in one direction. ;The overwhelming cause of whiplash is from rear-end auto accidents. ;A neck sprain or strain is another term for whiplash.;A rear-end auto accident can lead to years of pain. ;D
A mosquito-transmitted virus causes most cases of West Nile infection. Most people infected with West Nile virus either don't develop signs or symptoms or have only minor ones, such as fever and mild headache. However, some people develop a life-threatening illness that includes inflammation of the spinal cord or brain. Mild signs and symptoms of a West Nile virus infection generally go away on their own. But severe signs and symptoms — such as a severe headache, fever, disorienta- tion or sudden weakness — require imme- diate attention. Exposure to mosquitoes where West Nile virus exists increases your risk of getting infected. Protect yourself from mosquitoes by using mosquito repel- lent and wearing clothing that covers your skin to reduce your risk. (Mayo Clinic) ;Most people who are infected with the West Nile virus do not know they have it. ;Mosquito repellent and covering your skin with clothes will save you from getting the virus. ;West Nile infection is always caused by a mosquito-transmitted virus. ;Many people who are infected with the West Nile virus may not know they are. ;D
An increase in wind speed in recent years is good news for renewable energy produc- tion. Average global wind speed had been dropping since 1978, but this trend has reversed over the past decade. Researchers found that from 2010 to 2017, average global wind speed over land increased by 17 per- cent – from 3.13 to 3.30 metres per second. Before this, from 1978 to 2010, wind speed had been falling by 0.08 metres per second – or two percent – every decade. The reversal came as a surprise, says Zeng. Wind speed was thought to be declining because of increasing urbanisation resulting in more barriers, such as buildings, that slow down moving air. Why average global wind speed has been increasing since 2010, despite no reduction in urban development, isn’t known, says Zeng. (New Scientist);Wind speed is expected to continue to increase over the next few years. ;Climate change is believed to have con- tributed to the increase in wind speed. ;The change in global wind speed has chal- lenged a theory proposed by scientists. ;Despite what scientists thought, urban devel- opment does not impact wind speed. ;C
Children are growing up in a warmer world that will hit them with more and different health problems than their parents experi- enced, an international report said. “A child born today, as they go through their lives, they will be increasingly exposed to more and more harms that I did not experience,” said study co-author Dr. Renee Salas. Already, the number of days when condi- tions are ripe for the spread of the water- borne bacteria Vibrio, a major cause of debilitating diarrhoea, have doubled since 1980 with last year ranking second highest on record, the report said. Because of the warming climate, 29% more of the U.S. coastline is vulnerable to Vibrio. Nine of the top 10 years where conditions were most ripe for dengue fever transmission have occurred since 2000, the report said. Those diseases hit children harder, the report said. (AP News) ;It cannot be said that climate change will impede the spread of diseases. ;The number of days that favour the spread of Vibrio has increased each year since 1980. ;Today’s children will grow up in a wetter world exposing them to more health prob- lems. ;Children growing up today will have higher rates of catching Vibrio or dengue fever. ;A
Ash dieback is caused by the fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, which origi- nated in Asia. In its native range, it causes little damage to trees, but when the fungus was introduced to Europe about 30 years ago, it caused widespread destruction. Recent estimates suggest that the disease can kill up to 70% of ash trees. In the UK, this means 70 million trees could be lost, which would cost the economy £15bn, according to an analysis published this year. In a bid to halt this seemingly unstoppable disease, scientists have been studying the DNA of hundreds of ash trees. A small number of trees are showing some natural resistance to ash dieback − and the researchers have identified the parts of their genome that are helping this fightback. “We've discovered about 3,000 locations in the DNA of these ash trees that are con- tributing to the resistance,” explained Prof Richard Buggs. (BBC News);Finding what makes Asian ash trees resistant could help European ash trees. ;Ash dieback runs the risk of wiping out the ash trees found in Europe. ;Scientists are racing to stop ash dieback due to the potential economic costs. ;There are approximately 100 million ash trees within the United Kingdom. ;D
Husbands are least stressed when their wives earn up to 40 percent of household income but they become increasingly uncomfortable as their spouse’s wages rise beyond that point and are most stressed when they are entirely economically depen- dent on their partner, new research from the University of Bath shows. The study of over 6,000 American heterosexual couples over 15 years showed husbands are at their most anxious when they are the sole breadwin- ner, shouldering all the burden of responsi- bility for the household’s finances. Stress levels decline as their wives’ earnings approach 40 percent of household income. But as women’s earnings go above that point, the study showed husbands’ stress levels gradually increasing. “These findings suggest that social norms about male bread- winning – and traditional conventions about men earning more than their wives − can be dangerous for men’s health. They also show how strong and persistent are gender identity norms,” said Dr Joanna Syrda. (bath.ac.uk) ;Men do better as the sole breadwinner than when entirely economically dependent. ;The study found men do best as the primary breadwinner in a household. ;According to the study, it did not matter whether the spouse was of the same gender or not. ;Men felt increased anxiety when they were not following traditional gender norms. ;B
Researchers have found that, on average, children who had an older sibling had worse language skills than those who didn’t. The sex of an older sibling was important, however: kids with older sisters had better language skills than those with older brothers. In fact, a subsequent analy- sis showed that children with an older sister didn’t actually differ in their language skills from those with no older sibling. It’s not yet clear why children perform better when they have older sisters, the researchers write. It could be that sisters have better language abilities or are more nurturing than brothers — but another pos- sible explanation is that sisters are less demanding on their parents, taking less parental attention away from their younger siblings than do brothers. Whatever the reason, the authors say, “it ... might be more accurate to think of the well-established negative older-sibling effect as an older- brother effect.” (British Psychological Society) ;Girls learn faster at younger ages, hence the difference in language skills. ;Boys’ behaviour towards their parents is why their younger siblings have worse language skills. ;Only older brothers were found to be detri- mental to younger siblings’ language skills. ;Older brothers spend more time with younger siblings and keep them from their parents more. ;C
More and more Americans are trying to lose weight, but few are finding success, a new study has found. According to figures pub- lished Wednesday in the journal JAMA: Diabetes and Endocrinology, the percentage of U.S. adults 20 and older that have attempted a weight-loss regimen has increased from 34.3 percent in 1999 to 42.2 percent in 2016. However, over the same period, researchers found increases in weight and weight gain − an indication that their efforts may be in vain. Notably, over the 18-year study period, mean weight of the participants increased from approxi- mately 176 pounds to roughly 184 pounds. And, though a minimum of one in four par- ticipants reported trying to lose weight in each of the two-year periods, they appeared to be unsuccessful. For example, among those trying to lose weight within the 2015- 16 time frame, there was a reported mean weight gain of eight pounds. (UPI);Efforts to lose weight by Americans cannot be generally said to correlate with actual weight loss. ;For some unknown reason, Americans were not able to lose weight despite trying. ;The study found that too many Americans lacked the willpower to lose weight. ;A minimum of a quarter of the participants in the study attempted to lose weight. ;A
A nationwide poll of 819 parents with at least one child in middle school, junior high or high school found that while one-third were confident they could detect depression in their children, two-thirds said certain things would make it difficult. About 30 percent of parents said their child is good at hiding feelings and 40 percent said they struggle to differentiate between their child's normal mood swings and signs of depression. “In many families, the preteen and teen years bring dramatic changes both in youth behaviour and in the dynamic between parents and children,” poll co- director Sarah Clark explained. “These tran- sitions can make it particularly challenging to get a read on children's emotional state and whether there is possible depression,” she added. “Some parents may be overesti- mating their ability to recognize depression in the mood and behaviour of their own child,” Clark noted. “An overconfident parent may fail to pick up on the subtle sig- nals that something is amiss.” (UPI);Less confident parents were more likely to pick up on subtle signals that something is wrong. ;About 70 percent of parents could not read their children’s feelings well. ;Roughly two-thirds of parents did not express confidence in detecting depression in their kids. ;Nearly one-third of parents overestimated their ability to detect depression in their chil- dren. ;C
"New research finds that a person's risk of
atrial fibrillation (a-fib) increases by about 3
percent for every inch over the average
height of 5-foot-7. Further, it appears that
certain genes linked to height also are asso-
ciated with a-fib, said lead researcher Dr.
Michael Levin, a cardiology fellow at the
University of Pennsylvania Perelman chool of Medicine. Atrial fibrillation is a quivering or irregular heartbeat that
increases a person's risk of stroke fivefold. It also raises risk of blood clots, heart failure and other heart-related diseases, the American Heart Association says. Knowing that tall folks are at increased risk of a-fib could help prevent deaths and disease related to the heart condition, Levin said. “While we can't change your height, we may be able to modify other risk factors for a-fib in taller individuals and be more aggressive about controlling blood pressure or diabetes or cholesterol,” Levin said. (UPI)";The reason the risk of atrial fibrillation increases in tall people is that their hearts work harder. ;According to the study, the taller a person is, the greater the risk of having a stroke. ;Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of a stroke because it raises the risk of blood clots. ;Aggressive control of blood pressure and dia- betes can reduce tall people’s risk of stroke to normal levels. ;B
There are many myths about unwanted intrusive thoughts. One of the most dis- tressing is that having such thoughts mean that you unconsciously want to do the things that come into your mind. This is simply not true, and, in fact, the opposite is true. It is the effort people use to fight the thought that makes it stick and fuels its return. People fight thoughts because the content seems alien, unacceptable, and at odds with who they are. So, people with violent unwanted intrusive thoughts are gentle people. People who have unwanted intrusive thoughts about suicide love life. And those who have thoughts of yelling blasphemies in church value their religious life. A second myth is that every thought we have is worth examining. In truth, these thoughts are not messages, red flags, signals or warnings--despite how they feel. (Anxiety and Depression Association of America);Most of the common knowledge surrounding intrusive thoughts is mistaken.;By not fighting an intrusive thought, a person will come to actually act them out.;Having an intrusive thought is the subconscious showing what a person really wants to do.;Paradoxically, fighting intrusive thoughts only serves to make them stronger. ;D
Why do people get tired when they travel long distances in certain vehicles? When you’re traveling on a road, your car/bus is bound to accelerate/decelerate countless times, thanks to the natural flow of traffic. In addition to that, the vehicle will also take many turns, which are bound to repeatedly sway you from one side to another. In addi- tion to the umpteen turns, swaying and con- stant changes in speed, there are a few other factors at play, such as the condition of the automobile, passenger seats and even the quality of the roads. All of these factors have a cumulative effect on passenger com- fort. You don’t realize it actively, but the constant sways and changes in speed cause you to remain upright. Your brain keeps your muscles engaged to account for these movements of the vehicle to ensure that your posture is properly maintained. These small movements cause your muscles to constantly work, which makes them tired over a long journey. (scienceabc.com) ;Long journeys in old cars are usually more tiring than those in new ones. ;It’s generally more tiring to travel by car than by train. ;Long car journeys tire people because they are using their muscles throughout. ;Driving on a straight road is less tiring than driving on a twisting road. ;C
This might seem like a no-brainer, but when you stand still, you don’t actually stand absolutely still. The body has the ten- dency to sway a little (thus shifting the bodyweight on either leg) almost con- stantly. In order to keep you upright, there- fore, certain leg muscles, particularly in the calves, must constantly make small adjust- ments. In contrast, when you’re walking, a greater number of muscles in both the legs are engaged. Additionally, they also get assistance from the core muscles, which keep your gait stable. That’s one of the pri- mary reasons why walking doesn’t hurt nearly as much as standing still for the same amount of time. When one is walking, the body weight is borne alternatively by either leg. This way, both legs get rest very fre- quently, even if it lasts for only a second. (scienceabc.com) ;Certain leg muscles are more prone to becoming painful from extended use than others. ;The core muscles are what make walking less painful than standing. ;Using less muscles made an activity more painful than one that uses more muscles. ;Walking is less painful than standing because it involves both legs as opposed to standing. ;C
Urban dwellers who live in close proximity to greenery are less likely to die before their life expectancy, per the findings of a new study. Green spaces like parks are excellent venues for physical activity, another health- boosting activity, David Rojas-Rueda said. Vegetation can act as a buffer between resi- dents and blaring city racket, even if it's as simple as a tree-lined street. Plants also help regulate temperature and extremity of envi- ronments, tempering the effects of climate change, he said. More research is needed to determine the most evident benefit of urban green spaces. Narrower studies have already outlined a few significant improve- ments. That study's authors laid out specifics: Women who lived among lush greenery had a 41% lower death rate for kidney disease, 34% lower death rate for respiratory disease (trees' leaves trap air pollutants) and 13% lower death rate for cancer. (CNN) ;Urban dwellers living near greenery will reach the end of their life expectancy. ;The study found that the mere presence of some greenery already provided benefits to people. ;The greatest benefit of green spaces was how they increased life expectancies in people. ;People living among lush greenery had a bigger reduction in death rate for kidney dis- ease than for respiratory disease. ;B
People with lactose intolerance are unable to fully digest the sugar (lactose) in milk. As a result, they have diarrhoea, gas and bloat- ing after eating or drinking dairy products. The condition, which is also called lactose malabsorption, is usually harmless, but its symptoms can be uncomfortable. A defi- ciency of lactase — an enzyme produced in your small intestine — is usually responsi- ble for lactose intolerance. Many people have low levels of lactase but are able to digest milk products without problems. If you're actually lactose intolerant, though, your lactase deficiency leads to symptoms after you eat dairy foods. Most people with lactose intolerance can manage the condi- tion without having to give up all dairy foods. (Mayo Clinic) ;A deficiency of lactase is in most cases the culprit in lactose malabsorption. ;Being lactose intolerant means that a person has to avoid eating dairy foods. ;Lactose intolerance occurs when people pro- duce low levels of lactase. ;Lactose intolerance, while generally harm- less, can also be quite dangerous in some cases. ;A
In the moments after a snowstorm con- cludes, leaving behind a landscape shrouded in white, the great outdoors often becomes noticeably quieter. As it turns out, there's a scientific reason behind the calm- ing silence, with the characteristics of snow playing a big role in how sound can travel. When light, fluffy snow accumulates on the ground, it acts as a sound absorber, dampen- ing sound waves much like commercial sound absorbing products. However, as the structure of snow changes, the amount of noise in the surrounding environment could increase. When the snow surface melts and refreezes, it can become hard and reflect sound waves, causing sounds to travel farther and become clearer, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. (Accuweather);The reason it becomes totally quiet after a snowfall is that the snow absorbs sound. ;Refrozen snow is only half as effective at absorbing sound as freshly fallen snow. ;The deeper the snow, the quieter it gets. ;A big snowfall can end up making it noisier. ;D
Sunspots are darker, cooler areas on the sur- face of the sun in a region called the photo- sphere. The photosphere has a temperature of 5,800 degrees Kelvin. Sunspots have tem- peratures of about 3,800 degrees K. They look dark only in comparison with the brighter and hotter regions of the photo- sphere around them. Sunspots can be very large, up to 50,000 kilometres in diameter. They are caused by interactions with the Sun's magnetic field which are not fully understood. But a sunspot is somewhat like the cap on a soda bottle: shake it up, and you can generate a big eruption. Sunspots occur over regions of intense magnetic activity, and when that energy is released, solar flares and big storms called coronal mass ejections erupt from sunspots. (space.com) ;Despite appearances, sunspots are not actu- ally dark areas on the sun’s surface. ;Sunspots are darker and cold spots on the sun’s surface in an area called the photo- sphere. ;Sunspots are cooler areas, usually a bit bigger than the size of the Earth, on the surface of the sun. ;Solar flares and coronal mass ejections can only be launched from sunspots. ;A
Red sprites and blue jets are flashes of light that occur above thunderstorms and that are associated with normal lightning in the thundercloud below. The causes of both phenomena are not known. Red sprites tend to form almost instantaneously over a broad region between 40 and 90 km in altitude. This region spans most of the mesosphere, the region of the atmosphere between about 50 and 80 km in altitude and which overlaps much of the ionospheric D region (between 70 and 90 km in altitude). Red sprites have a reddish colour on low-light television records, and blue tendrils have been observed trailing beneath them. Blue jets propagate out of the tops of thunderclouds at surprisingly low velocities (roughly 100 km per second) in the form of narrow cones of light that are blue in colour. Both phe- nomena are the subject of active research. (britannica.com);Blue jets can reach greater altitudes than red sprites. ;Blue tendrils trail at around 100 km per second. ;An unexplained phenomenon occurs in the ionospheric D region. ;Red sprites only form in the part of the atmo- sphere known as the mesosphere. ;C
"Glaciers are formed by the recrystallization of snow or other solid precipitation that does not significantly melt, even during melting season. The fallen snow com- presses over many years (at a rate that depends on temperature and wetness) into ice. A glacier may also gain mass from the refreezing of meltwater at its base. Though glaciers are fed mainly by snowfall, they may also grow as a result of freezing of rain, hail, hoarfrost, and rime; avalanches may contribute snow to a glacier as well. Glaciers are found in Arctic areas, Antarctica, and on high mountains in tem- perate and even tropical climates. Glaciers that extend in continuous sheets and cover a large landmass, such as Antarctica or Greenland, are called ice sheets. If they are similar but smaller, they are termed ice caps. (britannica.com) ";Elevation is not essential for determining if glaciers can form. ;It cannot be said that glaciers can exist at all latitudes of the Earth. ;The largest glaciers can be found in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. ;Glaciers form the fastest in areas that are the coldest. ;A
Eating two apples a day may reduce people's risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke, experts found. When 40 people with slightly high cholesterol ate two large apples a day for eight weeks, it lowered their levels of “bad” cholesterol by almost four percent. That could help to reduce their risk of a stroke or heart attack, which can be caused by cholesterol hardening the arter- ies. Two large apples contain about a quar- ter of someone's recommended daily fibre, and a type of fibre that fuels bacteria in the gut which may reduce cholesterol. This could explain the traditional advice that “an apple a day keeps the doctor away”. Researchers also found people had health- ier, more relaxed blood vessels after eating apples daily, which is similar to an effect seen in other foods containing natural com- pounds called polyphenols, such as red wine and tea. (Daily Mail);Eating two large apples a day for eight weeks lowered bad cholesterol levels fourfold. ;Apples contain a type of fibre that fuels bac- teria in the gut that reduce cholesterol. ;Drinking red wine or tea is as good for you as eating apples. ;Consuming two apples a day might make a positive impact on your cholesterol levels. ;D
While recent research has shown that cannabis access laws can reduce the use of prescription opioids, the effect of these laws on opioid use is not well understood for all dimensions of use and for the general United States population. Analysing a dataset of over 1.5 billion individual opioid prescriptions between 2011 and 2018, which were aggregated to the individual provider- year level, it was found that recreational and medical cannabis access laws reduced the number of morphine milligram equiva- lents prescribed each year by 11.8 and 4.2 percent, respectively. These laws also reduced the total days supply of opioids prescribed, the total number of patients receiving opioids, and the probability a provider prescribes any opioids net of any offsetting effects. Additionally, the study found consistent evidence that cannabis access laws have different effects across types of providers, physician specialties, and payers. (sciencedirect.com) ;Following this research, more US states will relax their restrictions on cannabis. ;A dataset of over 1.5 billion records has not led to certainty about the effects of cannabis access laws. ;Laws that allow access to cannabis have been proven to reduce the use of prescription opi- oids. ;Cannabis laws were found to have a uniform effect on prescription opioid use. ;B
About 84% of official workplace social events involve alcohol, according to research carried out for the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. During the Christmas party season 40% of businesses that are planning a Christmas event say that alcohol will be freely avail- able and paid for by the company, while 39% say alcohol will be available to buy with no limit. The impact can be positive and negative. Four out of 10 HR managers surveyed said that alcohol can cause prob- lems at work. But almost 50% of the man- agers said having some drinks at social events had a positive effect on morale and team bonding. (BBC News) ;Drinking to excess is a common feature of workplace social events involving alcohol. ;It cannot be said that a minority of HR man- agers found that drinks at social events have positive effects. ;Only a minority of workplace social events appear to place limits on alcohol consump- tion. ;Christmas events with free alcohol cause more problems than those where employees pay. ;C
A third of the poorest countries in the world are dealing with high levels of obesity as well as under-nourishment, which leaves people too thin, according to a report in The Lancet. It says the problem is caused by global access to ultra-processed foods, and people exercising less. The report estimates that nearly 2.3 billion children and adults on the planet are overweight, and more than 150 million children have stunted growth. And many low and middle-income coun- tries are facing these two issues at once − known as the “double burden of malnutri- tion”. This means that 20% of people are overweight, 30% of children under four are not growing properly, and 20% of women are classified as thin. Communities and families can be affected by both forms of malnutrition, as well as individual people at different points in their lives, the report says. According to the report, 45 out of 123 countries were affected by the burden in the 1990s, and 48 out of 126 countries in the 2010s. (BBC News);Ultra-processed foods are the main reason why people in poor countries are becoming more obese. ;Being overweight and also experiencing stunted growth are not mutually exclusive. ;A combination of obesity and undernourish- ment causes people to be too thin. ;The number of countries affected by the double burden has grown significantly. ;B
A team collected hair from several mammal species, including humans, and pulled strands until they broke. The researchers examined the broken ends with scanning electron microscopy. They found that thin hair, such as human hair, tends to break in long cracks, with individual keratin fibres coming unstuck. Thicker hair, such as ele- phant hair, tends to break cleanly straight across. Counterintuitively, the researchers found that thin hair tends to be stronger than thick—a phenomenon they suggest is related to the size and quantity of flaws in the hair strand. One exception was capybara hair, the strands of which have an indent down the middle believed to help shed water. That hair tended to fail along that centre line, giving it a lower tensile strength than expected. (cen.acs.org) ;Thick hair tends to be weaker because it has more flaws. ;Researchers found the strength of hair was inversely proportional to its thickness. ;Capybara hair is the one exception to the rule that thinner hair is stronger. ;Human hair was found to be among the strongest types of hair. ;A
Multiple systems that are designed to make driving safer and easier are placing drivers in danger, according to a new study. Adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping- assist technologies lull drivers into letting their guard down, which puts them at greater risk of crashing. When used cor- rectly, the technologies can make people safer. But many drivers place too much trust in the systems, according to the study. Evidence increasingly suggests that drivers often don't properly use or understand par- tially automated systems. The AAA study concluded that those two systems make drivers “nearly twice as likely to engage in distracted driving” as drivers who aren't using them. Perhaps counterintuitively, drivers who aren't as familiar with the sys- tems are less likely to drive distracted while using them, according to the AAA. (USA Today);The AAA thinks that two systems that increase the risk of crashes should be discour- aged. ;Cruise control and lane-keeping-assist tech- nologies inevitably make driving more dan- gerous. ;Driving assisting technologies were found to have the potential to increase driving risks. ;When drivers use both technologies, they are almost twice as likely to not pay as much attention. ;C
Universities are accused of being left wing bastions, unwelcoming to conservative and right wing professors. However, we know little about the political orientation of pro- fessors in comparison to other profession- als, which would be the right comparison group if we want to know whether universi- ties are potentially hostile environments to conservatives. Examining culturally and economically oriented political orientations in Europe, it is demonstrated that professors are more liberal and left leaning than other professionals. However, there is no greater homogeneity of political orientations among the professoriate relative to other specific professions, suggesting that there is a diversity of opinions which is similar to what professionals would find in other occupations. Importantly, the difference between professors and other professionals is not so clear within graduates from the social sciences, but emerges more clearly among graduates with a medical, STEM, economics or law degree. (wiley.com) ;Professors in the United States were found to be more liberal and left­leaning than other professionals. ;The study found that universities in Europe were hostile towards those with conservative values. ;The study found a lack of heterogeneity in beliefs by professors compared to other pro- fessionals. ;Professors and other professionals with social science degrees were found to have more similar political opinions than those with medical degrees. ;D
A new study found that people given accu- rate statistics on a controversial issue tended to misremember those numbers to fit commonly held beliefs. For example, when people are shown that the number of Mexican immigrants in the United States declined recently – which is true but goes against many people’s beliefs – they tend to remember the opposite. And when people pass along this misinformation they cre- ated, the numbers can get further and fur- ther from the truth. “People can self-generate their own misinformation. It doesn’t all come from external sources,” said Jason Coronel. “They may not be doing it purposely, but their own biases can lead them astray. And the problem becomes larger when they share their self-generated misinformation with others.” (news.osu.edu) ;The study found that people tended to create their own fake news. ;People will ignore the truth if it contradicts their opinions on things. ;The more information is passed on, the more it becomes distorted. ;People were found to deliberately distort the truth to their own beliefs. ;A
People distracted by their mobile phones are tripping, falling and hurting their heads and necks more often, with such injuries increasing “steeply” over a 20-year period, a new analysis has found. Most cases were mild, but some involved facial lacerations and traumatic brain injuries that could lead to long-term consequences, the authors warned. The study is believed to be the first to investigate the role smartphones play in injuries to these parts of the body. Previous studies have found that all types of “dis- tracted walking” injuries have been on the rise. Head and neck injuries related to mobile phone use were relatively rare until the rate began to increase sharply in 2007, the year the first iPhone was released, fol- lowed by a much steeper increase that peaked in 2016. Mobile phone users aged 13 to 29 made up almost 40 percent of the patients, and most of the injuries caused by distraction happened in this age group. (NBC News);Mobile phone distraction has resulted in a big increase in serious head and neck injuries. ;Older people were found to have higher rates of injury from distracted mobile use. ;The arrival of smartphones has led to medical problems. ;The ability of smartphones to browse the web or play games is why injuries increased. ;C
Puppies in pet stores appear to have trans- mitted a dangerous, antibiotic-resistant germ that's sickened 30 people across 13 states, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned. The infection in question is a multidrug-resistant form of Campylobacter jejuni, the agency said. So far, of 24 patients interviewed by the CDC, 21 − 88 percent − said they had recently touched a puppy. “Four people have been hospitalized,” the CDC said, although “no deaths have been reported. Interviews with ill people and laboratory evidence indicate that contact with puppies, especially those from pet stores, is the source of this out- break. Puppies and dogs can carry Campylobacter germs that can make people sick, even while appearing healthy and clean,” the CDC noted. So, “people who own, work with or come in contact with puppies or dogs should take steps to stay healthy.” (upi.com) ;A puppy bought from a pet store is likely to be a carrier for an antibiotic-resistant germ. ;Despite looking healthy and clean, puppies and dogs carry a variety of germs. ;Puppies sold in pet stores were more likely to carry the Campylobacter germ. ;The CDC reported that the majority of those who had touched puppies had become sick. ;C
Tropical forests that have been heavily logged -- cleared and replanted, cleared and replanted -- may never recover. According to a new study, continually logging tropical forests depletes the reserve of vital nutri- ents in the soil, diminishing the forest’s odds of long-term recovery. “Old-growth tropical forests that have been the same for millions of years are now changing irre- versibly due to repeated logging,” lead study author Tom Swinfield said. When sci- entists surveyed the health of trees in previ- ously logged forests on the island of Borneo, they found their leaves were thicker and featured lower concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous. Soil nutrients are essential to healthy vegetation. When trees die and decompose naturally, the nutrients are returned to the soil. When forests are logged, the nutrients are carried away with trees. Logging also increases soil erosion, further depleting the land of nitro- gen and phosphorous. Scientists estimated that as much as 30 percent of a forest's phos- phorous is lost when it is logged. (upi.com);Hopes that better tropical forest management can restore the previous ecosystem are mis- placed. ;It would be wrong to claim that repeated log- ging does damage. ;The effects seen in tropical forests are unlikely to be as serious in temperate forests. ;Repeated logging can be damaging, but a single cycle won’t cause much real damage. ;A
If you already have a cold, you're less likely to get the flu, and vice versa, a large new study shows. While this interaction between colds and the flu has been observed, a new study was large enough to provide strong evidence of it, according to its authors. The investigators tested for 11 types of respiratory viruses in more than 44,000 samples taken from more than 36,000 people with an acute respiratory illness. Of those people, 35 percent tested positive for a virus. Of those, 8 percent were infected with more than one type of virus. The most sig- nificant interaction was between influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses, a cause of the common cold. Computer modelling found that interactions between the two that inhibited infection with both appeared to occur in both individual people and the population as a whole. Patients with influenza A were about 70 percent less likely to also be infected with rhinovirus than patients infected with other virus types, according to the study. (upi.com) ;The study showed that the common cold could be used as a vaccine to prevent the flu. ;People who caught the flu or the rhinovirus were found to have immunity to the other. ;Understanding how these viral infections work could pave the way to a common cold vaccine. ;Catching one virus acts like a temporary vac- cine to lower the risk of catching the other type. ;D
Researchers studied the growth of the Italian broadcaster Mediaset, and found that those heavily exposed as children to its pabulum of cartoons, soap operas and quiz shows were almost 10% more likely to sup- port populists, because poorer cognitive skills left them more susceptible to politi- cians peddling simplistic arguments. Kids in towns where it was harder to pick up the Mediaset signal were less affected than their peers. The result was that heavy Mediaset consumers ended up with poorer cognitive skills, and less of an orientation to civic life, as well as performing worse on maths and literacy tests. Still, it’s crucial to grasp that this sort of “dumbing down” doesn’t happen because bad TV somehow injects stupidity into people’s heads. It’s about the opportunity cost: every hour you’re sitting in front of a rubbish cartoon is an hour you’re not reading, exploring the physical world, or watching educational programming. (The Guardian) ;For bad television to have a negative impact it simply has to replace something better. ;People who watched less television were less inclined to support populists. ;The study found that Italians were especially susceptible to being affected by television. ;Watching low quality television is certain to make people more supportive of populists. ;A
According to a study by the University of Manchester, we may have the wrong idea about blue light filters. Also referred to as night mode, the blue light filters on our devices are designed to help us sleep better at night by not messing with our circadian rhythm. It turns out this feature could be doing the exact opposite. Using specially designed lighting to adjust the colour tem- perature without changing the brightness, the team exposed mice to various colours and observed the effects it had. The results suggested blue light produced fewer effects on the mice’s body clock than yellow light. The research team says this makes sense since the evening is both dimmer and bluer than day time, and the body heavily relies on these two identifiers to determine appro- priate asleep and awake times. Using dimmer, cooler lights in the evening and brighter, warmer lights in the day may be more effective at helping manage our bodies natural sleep cycle. (androidauthor- ity.com);The colour of a light and not its brightness is what affected the mice’s ability to fall asleep. ;The night time light filters on our electronic devices may be having an unintended effect. ;Evening use of dimmer, warmer lights is better for our sleep patterns than cooler, brighter ones. ;The study found that yellow lights were more likely to keep people awake later at night. ;B
Scientists say they have discovered a possi- ble underlying cause of the neurological disorder, motor neurone disease (MND). The University of Exeter team says it has found evidence that MND is linked to an imbalance of cholesterol and other fats in cells. It says the research could lead to more accurate diagnosis and new treatments. MND affects around 5,000 people in the UK and causes more than 2,000 deaths a year. Scientists at the university say they had a “eureka moment” when they realised that 13 genes − which, if altered, can cause the condition − were directly involved in pro- cessing cholesterol. They say their theory could help predict the course and severity of the disease in patients and monitor the effect of potential new drugs. Lead author Prof Andrew Crosby said: “For years, we have known that a large number of genes are involved in motor neurone disease, but so far it hasn't been clear if there's a common underlying pathway that connects them.” (BBC News) ;The scientists found evidence that high cholesterol levels are linked to motor neu- rone disease. ;Discovering how genes process cholesterol could lead to a better understanding of the disease.;If the 13 genes can be altered back, then they can be prevented from causing the disease. ;The researchers had expected only one defec- tive gene would be involved in MND. ;B
In a recent study, children exposed to smok- ing in the first 4 years of life were more likely to exhibit symptoms of hyperactivity and conduct problems. The study found that the association remained even after controlling for family poverty level, parental education, parental history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, hos- tility, depression, caregiver IQ, and obstetric complications. The effects examined in the study, which included 1,096 children, were a function of the dosage of nicotine that chil- dren were exposed to, as quantified by the metabolic by-product cotinine in their saliva. The findings are consistent with animal models demonstrating an effect of exposure to nicotine on ongoing brain development in regions related to hyperac- tivity and impulsivity. “There is a lot of emphasis on the dangers of smoking during pregnancy, but our findings indicate that children continue to be vulnerable to the adverse effects of nicotine exposure during the first several years of life,” said lead author Lisa Gatzke-Kopp. (eurekalert.org) ;Hyperactivity in children is frequently caused by exposure to smoking in the first 4 years of life. ;Children’s exposure to smoking early in life is not as well understood as smoking during pregnancy. ;A child who exhibits hyperactivity could have been exposed to nicotine at a young age. ;It is the cotinine in the cigarettes that is thought to damage children. ;C
Northern Scotland registered a “remark- able” overnight temperature of 16.8°C in the early hours of 30 December, a record high for that time of year. Forecasters have attributed the unseasonably warm weather to a meteorological pattern called the Foehn Effect. It occurs in mountainous areas, creat- ing wet and cold conditions on one side of a mountain and warm and dry conditions on the other. The phenomenon occurs when humid air is pushed over high ground by strong winds. As the moisture-filled air rises, it cools and condenses, resulting in clouds and rain. This then releases dry air, which moves down the mountain’s other side, heating up and raising ground level temperatures as it travels. The effect coin- cided with gusts of warm air arriving from the southern Atlantic, which have resulted in Britain being warmer than Athens and Rome. (The Guardian);The Foehn Effect occurs when air hits a mountain and is diverted in a different direc- tion. ;On 30 December the Foehn effect raised the temperature by 16.8°C. ;Wet and cold air is as much a part of the Foehn Effect as warm and dry air is. ;The temperature of 16.8°C was remarkable because it occurred during the night-time. ;C
The North Atlantic Current transports warm water from the Gulf of Mexico towards Europe, providing much of north-western Europe with a relatively mild climate. However, scientists suspect that meltwater from Greenland and excessive rainfall could interfere with this ocean current. Simulations by scientists from the University of Groningen and Utrecht University showed that it is unlikely that the current will come to a complete stop, due to small and rapid changes in precipita- tion over the North Atlantic. However, there is a 15 percent likelihood that there will be a temporary change in the current in the next 100 years. The current shows non- linear behaviour, which means that small changes can have large effects. Such tempo- rary transitions may cause cold spells in the North Atlantic, although this needs to be verified in further studies. (eurekalert.org) ;A small change in an ocean current could have large effects. ;Much of north-western Europe has a warm climate due to the North Atlantic Current. ;More studies are likely to find that temporary changes will cause cold spells in the North Atlantic. ;It cannot be said that the possibility exists that the current will undergo a transitory change. ;A
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a devel- opmental disorder that affects how a person behaves, interacts with others and learns. Previous studies have found that when one identical twin has ASD, chances are extremely likely that the other twin has it, too. A new study analysed data from three previous studies comprising a total of 366 identical twin pairs with and without ASD. The severity of autism traits and symptoms in the twins was measured by a clinician’s assessment or by parents’ ratings on a stan- dardized questionnaire. Some cases were diagnosed by both methods. The researchers determined a 96% chance that if one twin has ASD, the other has it, too. However, symptom scores varied greatly between twins diagnosed with ASD. The researchers estimated that genetic factors contributed to only 9% of the cause of trait variation among these twins. In contrast, among pairs of identical twins without ASD, the scores for traits were very similar. (eurekalert.org) ;Even if both twins had autism spectrum dis- order, the severity could be very different. ;If one twin does not have autism spectrum disorder, then neither twin will have the dis- order. ;Genetic factors were the leading single reason for the differing levels of severity in twins with ASD. ;ASD traits for identical twins were found to be more similar than for non-identical twins. ;A
The platypus is one of the few living mam- mals to produce venom. Males have a pair of spurs on their hind limbs that secrete venom that is active only in breeding season, supporting the hypothesis that the use of venom is for competition for mates, not for protection. While the spur remains available for defence, outside of breeding season the platypus's venom gland lacks secretion. While the venom's effects are described as excruciatingly painful, it is not lethal to humans. Many archaic mammal groups possess similar tarsal spurs, so it is thought that, rather than having developed this characteristic uniquely, the platypus simply inherited this characteristic from its antecedents. Rather than being a unique outlier, the platypus is the last demonstra- tion of what was once a common mam- malian characteristic, and it can be used as a model for non-therian mammals and their venom delivery and properties. (Wikipedia);Although today it is rare for mammals to have venom, it was once widespread. ;The platypus’s venom, while extremely painful, is not lethal to other animals. ;The platypus is the last example of once common mammals that produce venom.;It cannot be said that the venom of the female platypus is more painful than the male’s. ;D
The capacity of re-grown areas of the Amazon rainforest to draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and combat climate change may have been “vastly overesti- mated”, scientists fear. The forest is a gigan- tic carbon sink, drawing the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. Cleared areas that are re-planted are known as secondary forest, and have been seen as key to fighting cli- mate change, researchers at Lancaster University said. But a new study has found that those areas held just 40 percent as much carbon dioxide as sequestered by parts of the Amazon untouched by humans, casting doubt on their ability to aid in mitigating the crisis. And at the same time, global warming appeared to be hampering the re- growth of secondary forest. Scientists mon- itored forest regrowth over a period of 20 years and revealed how the Amazon was affected by periods of drought. During times of “water deficit”, regrown forests absorb less carbon from the atmosphere. (The Independent) ;Secondary forests were found to have no effect in capturing carbon from the atmo- sphere. ;Clearing areas in the Amazon has a lasting impact even when trees are later replanted. ;Rainforests are inherently more effective at capturing carbon than other forest types. ;Forests that go through cycles of replanting were found less able to absorb carbon. ;B
